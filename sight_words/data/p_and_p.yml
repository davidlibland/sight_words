- Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
- But it is, returned she; for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about
  it.
- Mr. Bennet made no answer.
- Do you not want to know who has taken it?
- _You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.
- This was invitation enough.
- What is his name?
- Is he married or single?
- Single, my dear, to be sure!
- A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.
- What a fine thing for our girls!
- How so?
- How can it affect them?
- My dear Mr. Bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome!
- You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.
- Is that his design in settling here?
- Nonsense, how can you talk so!
- I see no occasion for that.
- My dear, you flatter me.
- I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary
  now.
- When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her
  own beauty.
- In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.
- But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.
- It is more than I engage for, I assure you.
- But consider your daughters.
- Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.
- Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.
- You are over-scrupulous, surely.
- I desire you will do no such thing.
- But you are always giving _her_ the preference.
- Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
- You take delight in vexing me.
- You have no compassion for my poor nerves.
- You mistake me, my dear.
- I have a high respect for your nerves.
- They are my old friends.
- I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.
- Ah, you do not know what I suffer.
- It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.
- Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.
- _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop.
- She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.
- When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.
- The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting
  and news.
- Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.
- It was then disclosed in the following manner.
- I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.
- She has two nieces of her own.
- She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.
- No more have I, said Mr. Bennet; and I am glad to find that you do not depend on
  her serving you.
- Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heavens sake!
- Have a little compassion on my nerves.
- You tear them to pieces.
- Kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times them ill.
- I do not cough for my own amusement, replied Kitty fretfully.
- When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?
- To-morrow fortnight.
- Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley
  to _her_.
- I honour your circumspection.
- A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little.
- One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.
- The girls stared at their father.
- Mrs. Bennet said only, Nonsense, nonsense!
- What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?
- Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,
  as nonsense?
- I cannot quite agree with you _there_.
- What say you, Mary?
- For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make
  extracts.
- Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
- While Mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to Mr. Bingley.
- I am sick of Mr. Bingley, cried his wife.
- I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before?
- If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.
- It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the
  acquaintance now.
- How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!
- But I knew I should persuade you at last.
- I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.
- Well, how pleased I am!
- What an excellent father you have, girls!
- I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either,
  for that matter.
- Her report was highly favourable.
- Sir William had been delighted with him.
- Nothing could be more delightful!
- Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.
- And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogetherMr.
- Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
- His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.
- Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.
- What a contrast between him and his friend!
- His character was decided.
- Come, Darcy, said he, I must have you dance.
- I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.
- You had much better dance.
- I certainly shall not.
- You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.
- At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.
- I would not be so fastidious as you are, cried Mr. Bingley, for a kingdom!
- She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!
- Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.
- Which do you mean?
- You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
  your time with me.
- Mr. Bingley followed his advice.
- Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward
  him.
- The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.
- Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
- Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.
- Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.
- Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure.
- They found Mr. Bennet still up.
- I wish you had been there.
- Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
- Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!
- First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.
- I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!
- So he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.
- For Gods sake, say no more of his partners.
- Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!
- He is so excessively handsome!
- And his sisters are charming women.
- I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.
- I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hursts gown Here she was interrupted again.
- Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.
- So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!
- He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
- Not handsome enough to dance with!
- I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.
- I quite detest the man.
- He is also handsome, replied Elizabeth, which a young man ought likewise to be,
  if he possibly can.
- His character is thereby complete.
- I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
- I did not expect such a compliment.
- Did not you?
- _I_ did for you.
- But that is one great difference between us.
- Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.
- What could be more natural than his asking you again?
- He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other
  woman in the room.
- No thanks to his gallantry for that.
- Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.
- You have liked many a stupider person.
- Dear Lizzy!
- You never see a fault in anybody.
- All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.
- I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.
- I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.
- I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.
- With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
- Affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere.
- And so you like this mans sisters, too, do you?
- Their manners are not equal to his.
- Certainly notat first.
- But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.
- In understanding, Darcy was the superior.
- Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.
- In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.
- Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving
  offense.
- The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.
- Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.
- Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly
  intimate.
- The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.
- Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour
  to Mrs. Bennet.
- They had several children.
- _You_ began the evening well, Charlotte, said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command
  to Miss Lucas.
- _You_ were Mr. Bingleys first choice.
- Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.
- Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention
  it to you?
- Upon my word!
- _My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza, said Charlotte.
- Are you quite sure, maam?is not there a little mistake?
- I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.
- With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable.
- I do not believe a word of it, my dear.
- If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.
- I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long, said Miss Lucas, but I wish he had danced
  with Eliza.
- Another time, Lizzy, said her mother, I would not dance with _him_, if I were you.
- I believe, maam, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.
- If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.
- Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.
- A person may be proud without being vain.
- Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others
  think of us.
- I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.
- The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.
- The visit was soon returned in due form.
- She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
- In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels.
- But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.
- If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover
  it too.
- Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Janes disposition as you do.
- But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must
  find it out.
- Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.
- Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command
  his attention.
- When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much
  as she chooses.
- But these are not Janes feelings; she is not acting by design.
- As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.
- She has known him only a fortnight.
- This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.
- Not as you represent it.
- Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
- You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.
- You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.
- To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
- His doing so drew her notice.
- It was at Sir William Lucass, where a large party were assembled.
- That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.
- But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is
  about.
- With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.
- You are severe on us.
- It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased, said Miss Lucas.
- I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.
- On Miss Lucass persevering, however, she added, Very well, if it must be so, it
  must.
- Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.
- There is nothing like dancing after all.
- I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.
- Every savage can dance.
- Sir William only smiled.
- You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.
- Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.
- Do you often dance at St. Jamess?
- Never, sir.
- Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?
- It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.
- You have a house in town, I conclude?
- Mr. Darcy bowed.
- Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable
  partner.
- You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.
- I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.
- Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand,
  but in vain.
- Mr. Darcy is all politeness, said Elizabeth, smiling.
- Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.
- I should imagine not.
- I was never more annoyed!
- The insipidity, and yet the noisethe nothingness, and yet the self-importance of
  all those people!
- What would I give to hear your strictures on them!
- Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.
- My mind was more agreeably engaged.
- 'Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: Miss Elizabeth Bennet.'
- Miss Elizabeth Bennet!
- I am all astonishment.
- How long has she been such a favourite?and pray, when am I to wish you joy?
- That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.
- I knew you would be wishing me joy.
- Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled.
- Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.
- Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.
- Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections.
- Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers
  themselves.
- Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity
  unknown before.
- I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.
- If I wished to think slightingly of anybodys children, it should not be of my own,
  however.
- If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.
- Yesbut as it happens, they are all of them very clever.
- This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.
- My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father
  and mother.
- When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more
  than we do.
- What is it about?
- What does he say?
- Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.
- It is from Miss Bingley, said Jane, and then read it aloud.
- Come as soon as you can on receipt of this.
- I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.
- Dining out, said Mrs. Bennet, that is very unlucky.
- Can I have the carriage?
- I had much rather go in the coach.
- But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.
- They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?
- They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.
- But if you have got them to-day, said Elizabeth, my mothers purpose will be answered.
- She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.
- Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.
- Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.
- The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could
  not come back.
- This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!
- Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.
- My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.
- I am not afraid of her dying.
- People do not die of little trifling colds.
- She will be taken good care of.
- As long as she stays there, it is all very well.
- I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.
- She declared her resolution.
- How can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such a thing, in all this
  dirt!
- You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.
- I shall be very fit to see Janewhich is all I want.
- Is this a hint to me, Lizzy, said her father, to send for the horses?
- No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk.
- The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles.
- I shall be back by dinner.
- We will go as far as Meryton with you, said Catherine and Lydia.
- Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.
- Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.
- The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.
- Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
- Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough
  to leave her room.
- Elizabeth silently attended her.
- The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
  ached acutely.
- When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly
  said so.
- Jane was by no means better.
- Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with
  any complacency.
- She had very little notice from any but him.
- I shall never forget her appearance this morning.
- She really looked almost wild.
- She did, indeed, Louisa.
- I could hardly keep my countenance.
- Very nonsensical to come at all!
- Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?
- Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!
- Your picture may be very exact, Louisa, said Bingley; but this was all lost upon
  me.
- I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room
  this morning.
- Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.
- Certainly not.
- What could she mean by it?
- It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing, said Bingley.
- Not at all, he replied; they were brightened by the exercise.
- But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
  no chance of it.
- I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.
- Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.
- That is capital, added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
- Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
- Do you prefer reading to cards?
- Miss Eliza Bennet, said Miss Bingley, despises cards.
- She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.
- He immediately offered to fetch her othersall that his library afforded.
- Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.
- I am astonished, said Miss Bingley, that my father should have left so small a collection
  of books.
- What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!
- It ought to be good, he replied, it has been the work of many generations.
- And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.
- I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.
- I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.
- Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.
- I wish it may.
- There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.
- With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.
- I am talking of possibilities, Charles.
- Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?
- I think she will.
- She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennets height, or rather taller.
- How I long to see her again!
- I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.
- Such a countenance, such manners!
- And so extremely accomplished for her age!
- Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.
- All young ladies accomplished!
- My dear Charles, what do you mean?
- Yes, all of them, I think.
- They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.
- Your list of the common extent of accomplishments, said Darcy, has too much truth.
- But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.
- Nor I, I am sure, said Miss Bingley.
- Then, observed Elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished
  woman.
- Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.
- I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
- I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.
- Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?
- _I_ never saw such a woman.
- _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe
  united.
- As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.
- But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.
- Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.
- Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.
- Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.
- The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.
- Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than
  she expected.
- Indeed I have, sir, was her answer.
- She is a great deal too ill to be moved.
- Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.
- We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.
- It must not be thought of.
- My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.
- Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
- I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.
- You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel
  walk.
- I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.
- You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short
  lease.
- At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.
- That is exactly what I should have supposed of you, said Elizabeth.
- You begin to comprehend me, do you?
- I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am
  afraid is pitiful.
- That is as it happens.
- I did not know before, continued Bingley immediately, that you were a studier of
  character.
- It must be an amusing study.
- Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.
- They have at least that advantage.
- The country, said Darcy, can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study.
- In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.
- But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed
  in them for ever.
- Yes, indeed, cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.
- I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.
- Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently
  away.
- Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her
  triumph.
- The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?
- They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.
- Ayethat is because you have the right disposition.
- But that gentleman, looking at Darcy, seemed to think the country was nothing at
  all.
- Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken, said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.
- You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.
- I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.
- Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.
- His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very
  expressive smile.
- Yes, she called yesterday with her father.
- What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?
- So much the man of fashion!
- So genteel and easy!
- He has always something to say to everybody.
- Did Charlotte dine with you?
- No, she would go home.
- I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
- It is a pity they are not handsome!
- Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plainbut then she is our particular friend.
- She seems a very pleasant young woman.
- Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Janes beauty.
- It is what everybody says.
- I do not trust my own partiality.
- But, however, he did not.
- Perhaps he thought her too young.
- However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.
- And so ended his affection, said Elizabeth impatiently.
- There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.
- I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!
- I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love, said Darcy.
- Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.
- Everything nourishes what is strong already.
- Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.
- But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill. Lydia declared herself satisfied.
- And when you have given _your_ ball, she added, I shall insist on their giving one
  also.
- I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.
- The day passed much as the day before had done.
- The loo-table, however, did not appear.
- Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
- How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!
- He made no answer.
- You write uncommonly fast.
- You are mistaken.
- I write rather slowly.
- How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
- Letters of business, too!
- How odious I should think them!
- It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.
- Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.
- I have already told her so once, by your desire.
- I am afraid you do not like your pen.
- Let me mend it for you.
- I mend pens remarkably well.
- Thank youbut I always mend my own.
- How can you contrive to write so even?
- He was silent.
- Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?
- At present I have not room to do them justice.
- I shall see her in January.
- But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?
- They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.
- He studies too much for words of four syllables.
- Do not you, Darcy?
- My style of writing is very different from yours.
- He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.
- Your humility, Mr. Bingley, said Elizabeth, must disarm reproof.
- Nothing is more deceitful, said Darcy, than the appearance of humility.
- It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.
- And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?
- You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.
- Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.
- To yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you.
- To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.
- You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and
  affection.
- I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.
- I see your design, Bingley, said his friend.
- You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.
- Perhaps I do.
- Arguments are too much like disputes.
- Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
- The supposition did not pain her.
- She liked him too little to care for his approbation.
- She smiled, but made no answer.
- He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.
- Indeed I do not dare.
- Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?
- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at
  Pemberley.
- Put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
- They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines.
- At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.
- Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.
- The path just admitted three.
- 'Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said: This walk is not wide enough
  for our party.'
- We had better go into the avenue.
- You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage.
- The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
- Their powers of conversation were considerable.
- He was full of joy and attention.
- He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
- Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
- When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-tablebut in
  vain.
- Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas
  and go to sleep.
- She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question,
  and read on.
- I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!
- How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!
- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.
- No one made any reply.
- Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much
  like a ball.
- Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the
  room.
- I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.
- Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.
- Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
  up.
- What could he mean?
- I have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon as she allowed
  him to speak.
- I never heard anything so abominable.
- How shall we punish him for such a speech?
- Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said Elizabeth.
- We can all plague and punish one another.
- Tease himlaugh at him.
- Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.
- But upon my honour, I do _not_.
- I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.
- Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind!
- No, no; I feel he may defy us there.
- Mr. Darcy may hug himself.
- Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!
- I dearly love a laugh.
- Miss Bingley, said he, has given me more credit than can be.
- Certainly, replied Elizabeththere are such people, but I hope I am not one of _them_.
- I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
- But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.
- Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.
- Such as vanity and pride.
- Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.
- But pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
  regulation.
- Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
- Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume, said Miss Bingley; and pray what
  is the result?
- I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.
- He owns it himself without disguise.
- No, said Darcy, I have made no such pretension.
- I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.
- My temper I dare not vouch for.
- It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of
  the world.
- My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.
- My temper would perhaps be called resentful.
- My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.
- _That_ is a failing indeed!
- Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.
- But you have chosen your fault well.
- I really cannot _laugh_ at it.
- You are safe from me.
- And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.
- And yours, he replied with a smile, is willfully to misunderstand them.
- Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?
- He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
- To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceElizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.
- On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took
  place.
- Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
- They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.
- Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.
- Who do you mean, my dear?
- I do not believe she often sees such at home.
- The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.
- Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled.
- A gentleman and a stranger!
- It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure!
- Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.
- Butgood Lord!
- There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.
- Lydia, my love, ring the bellI must speak to Hill this moment.
- Pray do not talk of that odious man.
- Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.
- I hate such false friends.
- Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?
- Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you
  will hear.
- Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.
- He must be an oddity, I think, said she.
- No, my dear, I think not.
- I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.
- There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises
  well.
- I am impatient to see him.
- In point of composition, said Mary, the letter does not seem defective.
- The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.
- To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.
- Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by
  the whole family.
- He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.
- His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.
- Things are settled so oddly.
- You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.
- It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.
- Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance
  in this world.
- There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.
- But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.
- They were not the only objects of Mr. Collinss admiration.
- He begged pardon for having displeased her.
- Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.
- Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.
- It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.
- Does she live near you, sir?
- I think you said she was a widow, sir?
- Has she any family?
- She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.
- And what sort of young lady is she?
- Is she handsome?
- She is a most charming young lady indeed.
- Has she been presented?
- I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.
- Mr. Bennets expectations were fully answered.
- Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.
- Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons.
- My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.
- But I will no longer importune my young cousin.
- Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.
- His plan did not vary on seeing them.
- Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
- Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.
- The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.
- Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.
- He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her.
- Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.
- What could be the meaning of it?
- It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
- The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good
  spirits.
- It was over at last, however.
- She dared not even mention that gentleman.
- Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.
- Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.
- Yes, replied Mr. Wickham; his estate there is a noble one.
- A clear ten thousand per annum.
- Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
- Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?
- As much as I ever wish to be, cried Elizabeth very warmly.
- I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.
- I have no right to give _my_ opinion, said Wickham, as to his being agreeable or
  otherwise.
- I am not qualified to form one.
- I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.
- It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.
- Here you are in your own family.
- He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
- Everybody is disgusted with his pride.
- You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.
- I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.
- Wickham only shook his head.
- I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.
- I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the
  neighbourhood.
- If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.
- Society, I own, is necessary to me.
- I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.
- I _must_ have employment and society.
- A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made
  it eligible.
- Yesthe late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in
  his gift.
- He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
- I cannot do justice to his kindness.
- Good heavens!
- How could his will be disregarded?
- Why did you not seek legal redress?
- There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no
  hope from law.
- I can recall nothing worse.
- But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.
- This is quite shocking!
- He deserves to be publicly disgraced.
- Some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_.
- Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.
- Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as
  he expressed them.
- But what, said she, after a pause, can have been his motive?
- What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?
- I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisthough I have never liked him.
- I had not thought so very ill of him.
- His disposition must be dreadful.
- I will not trust myself on the subject, replied Wickham; _I_ can hardly be just
  to him.
- He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.
- How strange!
- How abominable!
- I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!
- It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.
- Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?
- Family pride, and _filial_ pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave
  done this.
- What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?
- He shook his head.
- I wish I could call her amiable.
- It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.
- But she is too much like her brothervery, very proud.
- But she is nothing to me now.
- She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.
- How can they suit each other?
- Do you know Mr. Bingley?
- Not at all.
- He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.
- He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.
- Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.
- He does not want abilities.
- He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.
- The usual enquiries as to his success were made by the latter.
- Lady Catherine de Bourgh, she replied, has very lately given him a living.
- No, indeed, I did not.
- I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherines connections.
- I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.
- This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.
- Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
- Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.
- Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.
- Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.
- Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.
- Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
- It is impossible.
- No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be
  capable of it.
- Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?
- If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.
- Besides, there was truth in his looks.
- It is difficult indeedit is distressing.
- One does not know what to think.
- I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.
- The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of
  the family.
- And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.
- Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.
- There was no help for it, however.
- She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of
  something more.
- Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel
  about him.
- Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.
- The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of
  mortification.
- The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
- Heaven forbid!
- _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!
- To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!
- Do not wish me such an evil.
- He replied, and was again silent.
- He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.
- Very well.
- That reply will do for the present.
- Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
  ones.
- But _now_ we may be silent.
- Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?
- One must speak a little, you know.
- Both, replied Elizabeth archly; for I have always seen a great similarity in the
  turn of our minds.
- This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure, said he.
- How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.
- _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.
- I must not decide on my own performance.
- The effect was immediate.
- Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.
- I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.
- Such very superior dancing is not often seen.
- It is evident that you belong to the first circles.
- What congratulations will then flow in!
- I appeal to Mr. Darcy:but let me not interrupt you, sir.
- I do not think we were speaking at all.
- Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say
  for themselves.
- What think you of books?
- I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.
- I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want
  of subject.
- We may compare our different opinions.
- NoI cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.
- The _present_ always occupies you in such scenesdoes it?
- You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_ I am, said he, with
  a firm voice.
- And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?
- I hope not.
- May I ask to what these questions tend?
- Merely to the illustration of _your_ character, said she, endeavouring to shake
  off her gravity.
- I am trying to make it out.
- And what is your success?
- She shook her head.
- I do not get on at all.
- I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.
- But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.
- I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours, he coldly replied.
- I beg your pardon, replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
- Excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant.
- Insolent girl!
- You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.
- I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.
- No, replied Jane, I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell
  you.
- I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcys regard.
- Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?
- No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.
- This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.
- I am satisfied.
- But what does he say of the living?
- How wonderfully these sort of things occur!
- My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.
- You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!
- Indeed I am.
- I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
- I believe him to be Lady Catherines _nephew_.
- It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday
  sennight.
- It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.
- Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
- I have no reason, I assure you, said he, to be dissatisfied with my reception.
- Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.
- It was really a very handsome thought.
- Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.
- Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
- What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?
- For heavens sake, madam, speak lower.
- What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy?
- You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!
- Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.
- Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.
- Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.
- Elizabeth now began to revive.
- Elizabeth was in agonies.
- She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking
  to Bingley.
- She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing
  all night.
- You have delighted us long enough.
- Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.
- Others of the party were now applied to.
- The rector of a parish has much to do.
- The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.
- There was no arguing upon such a project.
- She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and
  rejoiced in it.
- Darcy said nothing at all.
- Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
- The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.
- Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.
- I am sure Lizzy will be very happyI am sure she can have no objection.
- Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.
- I beg you will not go.
- Mr. Collins must excuse me.
- He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
- I am going away myself.
- No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.
- I desire you to stay where you are.
- Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
- Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my
  future life.
- Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)
- A clergyman like you must marry.
- This is my advice.
- Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.
- This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me
  in your esteem.
- It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
- You are too hasty, sir, she cried.
- You forget that I have made no answer.
- Let me do it without further loss of time.
- Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.
- Upon my word, sir, cried Elizabeth, your hope is a rather extraordinary one after
  my declaration.
- I am perfectly serious in my refusal.
- Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.
- You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing
  what I say.
- This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.
- Really, Mr. Collins, cried Elizabeth with some warmth, you puzzle me exceedingly.
- I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.
- My feelings in every respect forbid it.
- Can I speak plainer?
- You are uniformly charming!
- But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins, she added, that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.
- I will speak to her about it directly.
- Sir, you quite misunderstand me, said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
- Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.
- In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.
- I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am
  sure.
- Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
- I have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had finished her
  speech.
- Of what are you talking?
- Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.
- And what am I to do on the occasion?
- It seems an hopeless business.
- Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.
- Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.
- Let her be called down.
- She shall hear my opinion.
- Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.
- Come here, child, cried her father as she appeared.
- I have sent for you on an affair of importance.
- I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.
- Is it true?
- Elizabeth replied that it was.
- Very welland this offer of marriage you have refused?
- I have, sir.
- Very well.
- We now come to the point.
- Your mother insists upon your accepting it.
- Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?
- Yes, or I will never see her again.
- An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.
- From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.
- What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?
- You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.
- My dear, replied her husband, I have two small favours to request.
- I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.
- Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet
  give up the point.
- She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.
- Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
- Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
- While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with
  them.
- What do you think has happened this morning?
- Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.
- I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.
- Charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
- _I_ shall not be able to keep youand so I warn you.
- I have done with you from this very day.
- I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.
- Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.
- People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination
  for talking.
- Nobody can tell what I suffer!
- But it is always so.
- Those who do not complain are never pitied.
- 'In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: Oh!'
- Mr. Collins!
- My dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this point.
- But we are all liable to error.
- I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
- The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennets ill-humour or ill health.
- Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
- He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
- Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield.
- You shall hear what she says.
- I depend on you for that.
- Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.
- Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this
  winter.
- It is evident by this, added Jane, that he comes back no more this winter.
- It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.
- Why will you think so?
- It must be his own doing.
- He is his own master.
- But you do not know _all_.
- I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.
- I will have no reserves from _you_.
- What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?
- Is it not clear enough?
- Can there be any other opinion on the subject?
- Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.
- Will you hear it?
- Most willingly.
- You shall have it in a few words.
- Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss
  Darcy.
- Jane shook her head.
- Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.
- No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection.
- Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.
- She is not such a simpleton.
- But I know the foundation is unjust.
- That is right.
- You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in
  mine.
- Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
- You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.
- How can you talk so?
- But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
- A thousand things may arise in six months!
- The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.
- Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.
- It keeps him in good humour, said she, and I am more obliged to you than I can express.
- His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.
- But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
- The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.
- Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.
- She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.
- Her reflections were in general satisfactory.
- But still he would be her husband.
- You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.
- You cannot be too much upon your guard.
- But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.
- My dear Charlotteimpossible!
- I see what you are feeling, replied Charlotte.
- You must be surprised, very much surprisedso lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to
  marry you.
- But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what
  I have done.
- I am not romantic, you know; I never was.
- Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what
  she had heard.
- It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable
  a match.
- Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!
- Sir William, how can you tell such a story?
- Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?
- Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.
- Nor did that day wear out her resentment.
- Mr. Collinss return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.
  Bennet.
- On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.
- Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.
- It needed all Janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
- Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.
- The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.
- As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.
- She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
- My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.
- Let us hope for better things.
- Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.
- I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.
- If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.
- What should not you mind?
- I should not mind anything at all.
- Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.
- I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.
- Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?
- I leave it to yourself to determine, said Mr. Bennet.
- Miss Bingleys letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.
- Miss Darcys praise occupied the chief of it.
- Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all
  others.
- To Carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.
- It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must
  be unavailing.
- She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.
- But I will not repine.
- It cannot last long.
- He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.
- Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
- You doubt me, cried Jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have no reason.
- He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is
  all.
- I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.
- Thank God!
- I have not _that_ pain.
- A little time, thereforeI shall certainly try to get the better.
- My dear Jane!
- Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
  to you.
- I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.
- Nay, said Elizabeth, this is not fair.
- _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.
- _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.
- You need not.
- There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.
- I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlottes
  marriage.
- It is unaccountable!
- In every view it is unaccountable!
- My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.
- They will ruin your happiness.
- You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.
- Consider Mr. Collinss respectability, and Charlottes steady, prudent character.
- You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.
- But enough of this.
- You alluded to something else.
- You mentioned _two_ instances.
- We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
- We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.
- It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.
- Women fancy admiration means more than it does.
- And men take care that they should.
- And do you impute it to either of those?
- Yes; to the last.
- But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.
- Stop me whilst you can.
- You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?
- Yes, in conjunction with his friend.
- I cannot believe it.
- Why should they try to influence him?
- They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
  secure it.
- Your first position is false.
- They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
  her better.
- But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed
  their brothers.
- Do not distress me by the idea.
- Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.
- Mrs. Bennets best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
- Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.
- So, Lizzy, said he one day, your sister is crossed in love, I find.
- I congratulate her.
- Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
- It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.
- When is your turn to come?
- You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.
- Now is your time.
- Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.
- Let Wickham be your man.
- He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.
- Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.
- We must not all expect Janes good fortune.
- They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general
  unreserve.
- Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
- They had frequently been staying with her in town.
- When this was done she had a less active part to play.
- It became her turn to listen.
- Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.
- They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.
- Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
  in it.
- I do not blame Jane, she continued, for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could.
- But Lizzy!
- Oh, sister!
- He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.
- The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.
- They are all for what they can get.
- I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
- When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
- It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane, said she.
- I am sorry it went off.
- But these things happen so often!
- An excellent consolation in its way, said Elizabeth, but it will not do for _us_.
- We do not suffer by accident.
- Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingleys love?
- Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.
- Could there be finer symptoms?
- Is not general incivility the very essence of love?
- Oh, yes!of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
- Poor Jane!
- I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.
- It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out
  of it sooner.
- But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
- My dear aunt, how could you think of it?
- So much the better.
- I hope they will not meet at all.
- But does not Jane correspond with his sister?
- _She_ will not be able to help calling.
- She will drop the acquaintance entirely.
- To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with
  his general powers.
- Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly
  well.
- Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.
- Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.
- But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you.
- You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
- Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.
- You must not disappoint your father.
- My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.
- Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.
- Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.
- I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.
- He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.
- Elizabeth, you are not serious now.
- I beg your pardon, I will try again.
- At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.
- I see the imprudence of it.
- _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!
- My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable
  to forfeit it.
- My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.
- All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
- I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.
- When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.
- In short, I will do my best.
- Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
- At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.
- But do not imagine that he is always here so often.
- It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.
- You know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.
- _That_ you certainly shall.
- And I have another favour to ask you.
- Will you come and see me?
- We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.
- I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.
- Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.
- Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
- Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.
- Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally
  is.
- Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.
- She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
- I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her.
- I enquired after their brother, of course.
- He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.
- I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.
- I wish I could see her.
- My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.
- I dare say I shall see them soon here.
- Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.
- It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sisters being
  in town.
- Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.
- The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.
- I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.
- I cannot understand it.
- Let me hear from you very soon.
- We had better not mention it.
- I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.
- Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.
- I am sure you will be very comfortable there.Yours, etc.
- All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.
- She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.
- But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards
  Miss King.
- There can be no love in all this.
- Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
- Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.
- March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.
- She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.
- The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side
  even more.
- Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less
  agreeable.
- Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir Williams too long.
- All was joy and kindness.
- Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.
- It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.
- But my dear Elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is Miss King?
- I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.
- Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?
- If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.
- She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.
- I know no harm of her.
- Nowhy should he?
- But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after
  this event.
- If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?
- _Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_.
- It only shows her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling.
- Well, cried Elizabeth, have it as you choose.
- _He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.
- No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.
- I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in
  Derbyshire.
- I am sick of them all.
- Thank Heaven!
- Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.
- Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.
- We have not determined how far it shall carry us, said Mrs. Gardiner, but, perhaps,
  to the Lakes.
- Oh, my dear, dear aunt, she rapturously cried, what delight!
- You give me fresh life and vigour.
- Adieu to disappointment and spleen.
- What are young men to rocks and mountains?
- We _will_ know where we have gonewe _will_ recollect what we have seen.
- Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
  travellers.
- The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.
- Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
- At length the Parsonage was discernible.
- In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
- Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did
  not hear.
- It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
- She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.
- Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.
- We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.
- Her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us.
- I _should_ say, one of her ladyships carriages, for she has several.
- Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.
- She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.
- A lively imagination soon settled it all.
- I will not tell you what it is.
- Make haste, and come down this moment.
- And is this all?
- The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.
- Only look at her.
- She is quite a little creature.
- Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?
- She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
- Why does she not come in?
- Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.
- It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.
- I like her appearance, said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.
- She looks sickly and cross.
- Yes, she will do for him very well.
- She will make him a very proper wife.
- Mr. Collinss triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
- I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.
- But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
- About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.
- Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to
  Rosings.
- Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.
- She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.
- As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the
  park.
- Elizabeths courage did not fail her.
- There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.
- The party did not supply much conversation.
- Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat
  and admire.
- Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.
- Lady Catherine then observed, Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I
  think.
- It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourghs family.
- Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?
- A little.
- Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior toYou shall try it some day.
- Do your sisters play and sing?
- One of them does.
- Why did not you all learn?
- You ought all to have learned.
- The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.
- Do you draw?
- No, not at all.
- What, none of you?
- Not one.
- That is very strange.
- But I suppose you had no opportunity.
- Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.
- My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had any governess.
- No governess!
- How was that possible?
- Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!
- I never heard of such a thing.
- Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.
- Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.
- Then, who taught you?
- Without a governess, you must have been neglected.
- We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
- Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.
- It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.
- I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.
- Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me?
- She finds Miss Pope a treasure.
- Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.
- Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?
- Yes, maam, all.
- What, all five out at once?
- Very odd!
- And you only the second.
- The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!
- Your younger sisters must be very young?
- Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.
- Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.
- The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first.
- And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!
- I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
  mind.
- Upon my word, said her ladyship, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young
  a person.
- Pray, what is your age?
- You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.
- I am not one-and-twenty.
- When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed.
- Their table was superlatively stupid.
- A great deal more passed at the other table.
- Sir William did not say much.
- He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
- The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
- In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
- On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.
- Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.
- Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.
- Have you never happened to see her there?
- The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
- For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.
- What is it you are talking of?
- What are you telling Miss Bennet?
- Let me hear what it is.
- We are speaking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.
- Of music!
- Then pray speak aloud.
- It is of all subjects my delight.
- I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
- If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.
- And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.
- I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
- How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?
- Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency.
- I assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice.
- She practises very constantly.
- So much the better.
- I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
  constant practice.
- She would be in nobodys way, you know, in that part of the house.
- Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill-breeding, and made no answer.
- He drew a chair near her.
- I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.
- There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will
  of others.
- My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.
- I am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly.
- Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.
- I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.
- You shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
- Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.
- I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my
  own party.
- True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.
- Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?
- My fingers wait your orders.
- Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?
- I can answer your question, said Fitzwilliam, without applying to him.
- It is because he will not give himself the trouble.
- They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.
- It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other womans of superior
  execution.
- Darcy smiled and said, You are perfectly right.
- You have employed your time much better.
- No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.
- We neither of us perform to strangers.
- Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were
  talking of.
- Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
- She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Annes.
- Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.
- He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?
- Perfectly so, I thank you.
- Elizabeth made no answer.
- He took the hint, and soon began with, This seems a very comfortable house.
- Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to
  Hunsford.
- I believe she didand I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more
  grateful object.
- Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.
- An easy distance, do you call it?
- It is nearly fifty miles.
- And what is fifty miles of good road?
- Little more than half a days journey.
- Yes, I call it a very easy distance.
- I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.
- It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.
- Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.
- The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.
- Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance
  becomes no evil.
- But that is not the case _here_.
- _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.
- Elizabeth looked surprised.
- The _tte--tte_ surprised them.
- What can be the meaning of this?
- All field sports were over.
- But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.
- He seldom appeared really animated.
- Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.
- He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look
  was disputable.
- In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.
- More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr.
  Darcy.
- How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
- Yet it did, and even a third.
- His words seemed to imply it.
- Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
- She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise
  in that quarter.
- Are you going much farther?
- No, I should have turned in a moment.
- And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.
- Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?
- Yesif Darcy does not put it off again.
- But I am at his disposal.
- He arranges the business just as he pleases.
- I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than
  Mr. Darcy.
- He likes to have his own way very well, replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
- But so we all do.
- I speak feelingly.
- A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.
- In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
- Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
- But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.
- Younger sons cannot marry where they like.
- Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.
- Is this, thought Elizabeth, meant for me?
- Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty
  thousand pounds.
- He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.
- I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
- No, said Colonel Fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must divide with me.
- I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.
- Are you indeed?
- And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
- Does your charge give you much trouble?
- 'She directly replied: You need not be frightened.'
- She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
  Miss Bingley.
- I think I have heard you say that you know them.
- I know them a little.
- Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of Darcys.
- Care of him!
- Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most
  wants care.
- But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the
  person meant.
- It was all conjecture.
- What is it you mean?
- You may depend upon my not mentioning it.
- And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.
- Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?
- I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.
- And what arts did he use to separate them?
- He did not talk to me of his own arts, said Fitzwilliam, smiling.
- He only told me what I have now told you.
- Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.
- After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.
- I am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she.
- Your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings.
- Why was he to be the judge?
- You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?
- It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.
- She answered him with cold civility.
- He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
- Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.
- It will not do.
- My feelings will not be repressed.
- You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
- Elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression.
- She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.
- She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should
  have done.
- As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.
- He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.
- I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.
- It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.
- The pause was to Elizabeths feelings dreadful.
- But it is of small importance.
- Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?
- But I have other provocations.
- You know I have.
- No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.
- He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
- Can you deny that you have done it?
- Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself.
- But it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my dislike is founded.
- Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.
- Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from
  Mr. Wickham.
- On this subject, what can you have to say?
- In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
- Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?
- His misfortunes!
- And of your infliction, cried Elizabeth with energy.
- You have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty.
- You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.
- You have done all this!
- And this, cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, is your opinion
  of me!
- This is the estimation in which you hold me!
- I thank you for explaining it so fully.
- My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!
- But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
- Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.
- They were natural and just.
- You have said quite enough, madam.
- I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my
  own have been.
- The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.
- She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried
  for half-an-hour.
- Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review
  of it.
- That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!
- That he should have been in love with her for so many months!
- It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.
- Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?
- And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out
  of sight.
- The envelope itself was likewise full.
- Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.
- The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
- I had often seen him in love before.
- He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
- Your sister I also watched.
- If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in error.
- Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
- These causes must be stated, though briefly.
- Pardon me.
- It pains me to offend you.
- The part which I acted is now to be explained.
- I described, and enforced them earnestly.
- He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal
  regard.
- But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement
  than on his own.
- To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult
  point.
- I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
- I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant
  of it.
- On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
- Here again I shall give you painto what degree you only can tell.
- There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.
- All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
- I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.
- His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were
  exceedingly bad.
- After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.
- How he lived I know not.
- But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
- Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.
- You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
- His revenge would have been complete indeed.
- I will only add, God bless you.
- Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
- It was all pride and insolence.
- Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.
- She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, This must be false!
- This cannot be!
- So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference
  was great.
- On both sides it was only assertion.
- Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told
  himself.
- His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession
  of every virtue.
- But no such recollection befriended her.
- After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.
- But, alas!
- Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.
- How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
- She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.
- How despicably I have acted!
- I, who have valued myself on my abilities!
- How humiliating is this discovery!
- Yet, how just a humiliation!
- Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!
- But vanity, not love, has been my folly.
- Till this moment I never knew myself.
- Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.
- Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.
- The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.
- Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at
  it.
- Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.
- What would she have said?
- Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.
- But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached
  to me!
- They were excessively sorry to go!
- But so they always are.
- His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.
- Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.
- I must be in town next Saturday.
- Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.
- I expected you to stay two months.
- I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.
- There can be no occasion for your going so soon.
- Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.
- But my father cannot.
- He wrote last week to hurry my return.
- Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.
- You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.
- Lady Catherine seemed resigned.
- Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them.
- It is highly improper.
- You must contrive to send somebody.
- I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.
- Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation
  in life.
- I am excessively attentive to all those things.
- You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.
- My uncle is to send a servant for us.
- Your uncle!
- He keeps a man-servant, does he?
- I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.
- Where shall you change horses?
- Bromley, of course.
- If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.
- Mr. Darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
- She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely
  different.
- They were hopeless of remedy.
- They were ignorant, idle, and vain.
- The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.
- We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.
- Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
- You see on what a footing we are.
- You see how continually we are engaged there.
- You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear
  cousin.
- I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.
- My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
- There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between
  us.
- We seem to have been designed for each other.
- Poor Charlotte!
- Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage
  drove off.
- Good gracious!
- A great many indeed, said her companion with a sigh.
- We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
- How much I shall have to tell!
- Elizabeth added privately, And how much I shall have to conceal!
- But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough
  for observation.
- Is not this an agreeable surprise?
- Then, showing her purchasesLook here, I have bought this bonnet.
- I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.
- I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
  better.
- And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, Oh!
- Are they indeed!
- It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at
  all.
- Mamma would like to go too of all things!
- Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!
- Good Heaven!
- Now I have got some news for you, said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
- What do you think?
- It is excellent newscapital newsand about a certain person we all like!
- Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.
- 'Lydia laughed, and said: Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.'
- You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!
- I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.
- But he is an ugly fellow!
- I am glad he is gone.
- I never saw such a long chin in my life.
- Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is
  it not?
- There is no danger of Wickhams marrying Mary King.
- Theres for you!
- 'She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.'
- Wickham is safe.
- And Mary King is safe!
- She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.
- But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side, said Jane.
- I am sure there is not on _his_.
- How nicely we are all crammed in, cried Lydia.
- I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!
- Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.
- And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went
  away.
- Have you seen any pleasant men?
- Have you had any flirting?
- I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
- Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
- She is almost three-and-twenty!
- Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
- My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you cant think.
- Dear me!
- We dressed up Chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only
  think what fun!
- I thought I should have died.
- And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was
  the matter.
- Their reception at home was most kind.
- Mary, said she, I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
- And then when we came away it was such fun!
- I thought we never should have got into the coach.
- I was ready to die of laughter.
- And then we were so merry all the way home!
- To this Mary very gravely replied, Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate
  such pleasures!
- They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.
- But I confess they would have no charms for _me_I should infinitely prefer a book.
- But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.
- She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to
  Mary at all.
- There was another reason too for her opposition.
- She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.
- The comfort to _her_ of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
- You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?
- Blame you!
- Oh, no.
- But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?
- NoI do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.
- But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.
- What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
- This will not do, said Elizabeth; you never will be able to make both of them good
  for anything.
- Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.
- For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcys; but you shall do as you choose.
- It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
- I do not know when I have been more shocked, said she.
- Wickham so very bad!
- It is almost past belief.
- And poor Mr. Darcy!
- Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.
- Such a disappointment!
- It is really too distressing.
- I am sure you must feel it so.
- Poor Wickham!
- There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young
  men.
- One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.
- I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to
  do.
- And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without
  any reason.
- It is such a spur to ones genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of
  that kind.
- Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter
  as you do now.
- Indeed, I could not.
- I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.
- There is one point on which I want your advice.
- What is your opinion?
- That it ought not to be attempted.
- Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.
- I am not equal to it.
- Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what
  he really is.
- At present I will say nothing about it.
- You are quite right.
- To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.
- He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.
- We must not make him desperate.
- The tumult of Elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation.
- But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.
- The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!
- She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her
  sisters spirits.
- Jane was not happy.
- She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.
- Well, Lizzy, said Mrs. Bennet one day, what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business
  of Janes?
- For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.
- I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
- But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.
- I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.
- Oh well!
- Nobody wants him to come.
- But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no
  answer.
- Well, well, I only hope it will last.
- And what sort of table do they keep?
- Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.
- If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.
- There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.
- No, nothing at all.
- A great deal of good management, depend upon it.
- Yes, yes.
- _They_ will take care not to outrun their income.
- _They_ will never be distressed for money.
- Well, much good may it do them!
- And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.
- They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.
- It was a subject which they could not mention before me.
- Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much
  the better.
- _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.
- The first week of their return was soon gone.
- The second began.
- The dejection was almost universal.
- Good Heaven!
- What are we to do?
- How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?
- I am sure, said she, I cried for two days together when Colonel Millers regiment
  went away.
- I thought I should have broken my heart.
- I am sure I shall break _mine_, said Lydia.
- If one could but go to Brighton!
- Oh, yes!if one could but go to Brighton!
- But papa is so disagreeable.
- A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.
- And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good, added Kitty.
- Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House.
- Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.
- This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.
- I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years
  older.
- In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.
- Already arisen?
- What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?
- Poor little Lizzy!
- But do not be cast down.
- Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydias
  folly.
- Indeed you are mistaken.
- I have no such injuries to resent.
- It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.
- Excuse me, for I must speak plainly.
- In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.
- She will follow wherever Lydia leads.
- Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!
- We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.
- Let her go, then.
- At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been
  here.
- The officers will find women better worth their notice.
- Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.
- It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
- In Lydias imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly
  happiness.
- She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present
  unknown.
- They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
  same.
- Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.
- Her answer was warmly in his favour.
- 'With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added: How long did you say he was
  at Rosings?'
- Nearly three weeks.
- And you saw him frequently?
- Yes, almost every day.
- His manners are very different from his cousins.
- Yes, very different.
- But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.
- And pray, may I ask?
- But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, Is it in address that he improves?
- Oh, no!
- In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.
- The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.
- Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.
- He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
  enjoyments.
- Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour
  as a husband.
- But it is fortunate, thought she, that I have something to wish for.
- Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
- Everything wore a happier aspect.
- With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
- It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
  owner.
- The period of expectation was now doubled.
- Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival.
- A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.
- It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.
- Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
- My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?
- Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.
- Elizabeth was distressed.
- Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.
- They have some of the finest woods in the country.
- Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce.
- The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.
- It would be dreadful!
- To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
- The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
- Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.
- Elizabeth was delighted.
- She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.
- They followed her into the dining-parlour.
- It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.
- Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
- And of this place, thought she, I might have been mistress!
- With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
- This was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like regret.
- How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been
  delayed a day!
- Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.
- Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
- He is now gone into the army, she added; but I am afraid he has turned out very
  wild.
- Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.
- And that, said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, is my masterand
  very like him.
- It was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago.
- But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.
- Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?
- 'Elizabeth coloured, and said: A little.'
- And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, maam?
- Yes, very handsome.
- He was very fond of them.
- This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickhams being among them.
- And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?
- Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?
- Except, thought Elizabeth, when she goes to Ramsgate.
- If your master would marry, you might see more of him.
- Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.
- I do not know who is good enough for him.
- Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.
- I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him, replied the
  other.
- This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.
- That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
- You are lucky in having such a master.
- Yes, sir, I know I am.
- If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.
- Elizabeth almost stared at her.
- Can this be Mr. Darcy?
- His father was an excellent man, said Mrs. Gardiner.
- Yes, maam, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like himjust as affable
  to the poor.
- Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.
- Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point.
- There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name.
- Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.
- To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.
- In what an amiable light does this place him!
- Perhaps we might be deceived.
- That is not very likely; our authority was too good.
- He is certainly a good brother, said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the
  windows.
- Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcys delight, when she should enter the room.
- And this is always the way with him, she added.
- Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.
- There is nothing he would not do for her.
- Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.
- Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime.
- The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.
- What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?
- Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
  blush.
- She was overpowered by shame and vexation.
- Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!
- How strange it must appear to him!
- In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!
- It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!
- Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?
- She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.
- And his behaviour, so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean?
- She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.
- Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might
  be beyond a walk.
- With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
- The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him
  before they met.
- For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other
  path.
- Her colour changed, and she said no more.
- What will be his surprise, thought she, when he knows who they are?
- He takes them now for people of fashion.
- Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.
- It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no
  need to blush.
- Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive
  of wonder.
- Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be
  all for herself.
- Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, Why is
  he so altered?
- From what can it proceed?
- It cannot be for _me_it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.
- My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.
- It is impossible that he should still love me.
- Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.
- After a short silence, the lady first spoke.
- Bingley and his sisters.
- Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.
- They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.
- Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
- His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.
- At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.
- She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.
- He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming, said her uncle.
- I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.
- It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for
  such attention.
- His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.
- But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?
- But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities, replied her uncle.
- Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.
- He has not an ill-natured look.
- On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.
- But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming
  character!
- I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.
- But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends
  every virtue.
- Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.
- She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.
- To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.
- They had long wished to see him.
- The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.
- Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.
- Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
- In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
- No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.
- Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.
- We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at
  Netherfield.
- They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.
- It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among
  the poor.
- She certainly did not hate him.
- They were, therefore, to go.
- Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.
- Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
- Her own thoughts were employing her.
- She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.
- She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
- They must be a great loss to _your_ family.
- Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcys meditated elopement.
- But Georgiana would not join her.
- Her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could
  not err.
- She is grown so brown and coarse!
- Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.
- For my own part, she rejoined, I must confess that I never could see any beauty
  in her.
- Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not
  at all handsome.
- Her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines.
- Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably
  ill.
- The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago.
- What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
- Imagine our surprise.
- To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.
- I am very, very sorry.
- So imprudent a match on both sides!
- But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
- His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
- Our poor mother is sadly grieved.
- My father bears it better.
- The express was sent off directly.
- My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.
- Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.
- Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.
- I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.
- I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.
- All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
- I know not what to think.
- I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.
- Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.
- My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.
- My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.
- Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.
- And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.
- I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.
- My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover
  her.
- Good God!
- You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
- Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?
- A glass of wine; shall I get you one?
- You are very ill. No, I thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
- There is nothing the matter with me.
- She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak
  another word.
- At length she spoke again.
- I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.
- It cannot be concealed from anyone.
- They are gone off together from Brighton.
- _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.
- She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever.
- Darcy was fixed in astonishment.
- When I consider, she added in a yet more agitated voice, that _I_ might have prevented
  it!
- _I_ who knew what he was.
- Had I but explained some part of it onlysome part of what I learnt, to my own family!
- Had his character been known, this could not have happened.
- But it is allall too late now.
- I am grieved indeed, cried Darcy; grievedshocked.
- But is it certainabsolutely certain?
- Oh, yes!
- And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?
- But nothing can be doneI know very well that nothing can be done.
- How is such a man to be worked on?
- How are they even to be discovered?
- I have not the smallest hope.
- It is every way horrible!
- Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
- When _my_ eyes were opened to his real characterOh!
- But I knew notI was afraid of doing too much.
- Wretched, wretched mistake!
- Darcy made no answer.
- Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.
- But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.
- But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for
  your thanks.
- Oh, yes.
- Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.
- Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.
- Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.
- No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.
- Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.
- But now it was all too natural.
- Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.
- The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh!
- They were to be off as soon as possible.
- But what is to be done about Pemberley?
- John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?
- Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
- _That_ is all settled.
- That is all settled; repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.
- And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?
- Oh, that I knew how it was!
- Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?
- Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel
  Forster?
- His temptation is not adequate to the risk!
- Do you really think so?
- Upon my word, said Mrs. Gardiner, I begin to be of your uncles opinion.
- It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to
  be guilty of.
- I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.
- Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?
- Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe
  him capable.
- If, indeed, it should be so!
- But I dare not hope it.
- Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?
- And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.
- Well, thensupposing them to be in London.
- They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional
  purpose.
- But why all this secrecy?
- Why any fear of detection?
- Why must their marriage be private?
- Oh, no, nothis is not likely.
- Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.
- He cannot afford it.
- But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.
- But, really, I know not what to say.
- Perhaps I am not doing her justice.
- And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate
  a woman.
- Of whom does Jane ever think ill?
- But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.
- And do you really know all this?
- I do indeed, replied Elizabeth, colouring.
- Yet he knew to the contrary himself.
- He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.
- But does Lydia know nothing of this?
- Oh, yes!that, that is the worst of all.
- And when I returned home, the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnights
  time.
- That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.
- Not the slightest.
- When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
  were.
- From Elizabeths thoughts it was never absent.
- Not yet, replied Jane.
- But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.
- Is my father in town?
- Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.
- And have you heard from him often?
- We have heard only twice.
- He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance
  to mention.
- And my motherhow is she?
- How are you all?
- My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.
- She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.
- She does not yet leave her dressing-room.
- Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.
- But youhow are you?
- You look pale.
- How much you must have gone through!
- Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?
- Poor dear child!
- It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.
- And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
- Oh, brother, how kind you are!
- I know you will contrive it all.
- One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.
- Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any
  reply.
- Give me further particulars.
- What did Colonel Forster say?
- Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?
- They must have seen them together for ever.
- I am so grieved for him!
- His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.
- And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?
- Did he know of their intending to go off?
- Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?
- How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?
- My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match
  it must be.
- She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.
- But not before they went to Brighton?
- No, I believe not.
- And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?
- Does he know his real character?
- I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.
- He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.
- Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not
  have happened!
- Perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister.
- We acted with the best intentions.
- Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydias note to his wife?
- He brought it with him for us to see.
- Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.
- I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.
- What a good joke it will be!
- I can hardly write for laughing.
- Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him
  to-night.
- Give my love to Colonel Forster.
- I hope you will drink to our good journey.
- Your affectionate friend, LYDIA BENNET.
- What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
- But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their journey.
- Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_
  of infamy.
- My poor father!
- I never saw anyone so shocked.
- He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.
- My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!
- I do not know.
- I hope there was.
- But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult.
- But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.
- Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.
- You do not look well.
- Oh that I had been with you!
- She was of great use and comfort to us all.
- Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable.
- Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.
- Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
- At present we have nothing to guide us.
- Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this
  head.
- The arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience.
- The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.
- I am, dear sir, etc., etc.
- There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news
  of him.
- He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.
- Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family.
- Jane heard them with horror.
- A gamester!
- This is wholly unexpected.
- I had not an idea of it.
- What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?
- Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.
- Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?
- Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
- It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.
- When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.
- Who should suffer but myself?
- It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.
- You must not be too severe upon yourself, replied Elizabeth.
- You may well warn me against such an evil.
- Human nature is so prone to fall into it!
- No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.
- I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
- It will pass away soon enough.
- Do you suppose them to be in London?
- Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?
- And Lydia used to want to go to London, added Kitty.
- They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mothers tea.
- This is a parade, he cried, which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!
- I am not going to run away, papa, said Kitty fretfully.
- If _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.
- _You_ go to Brighton.
- I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds!
- No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of
  it.
- No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village.
- Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
- Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
- Well, well, said he, do not make yourself unhappy.
- If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the
  end of them.
- What do you mean, Hill?
- We have heard nothing from town.
- He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.
- Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
- Have you heard from my uncle?
- Yes I have had a letter from him by express.
- Well, and what news does it bringgood or bad?
- What is there of good to be expected?
- But perhaps you would like to read it.
- Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.
- Jane now came up.
- Read it aloud, said their father, for I hardly know myself what it is about.
- Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.
- The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.
- I have seen them both Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are married!
- 'Elizabeth read on: I have seen them both.'
- I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.
- Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.
- She comes to us to-day.
- I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.
- Yours, etc., EDW.
- Is it possible?
- Can it be possible that he will marry her?
- Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him, said her sister.
- My dear father, I congratulate you.
- And have you answered the letter?
- No; but it must be done soon.
- Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.
- Consider how important every moment is in such a case.
- Let me write for you, said Jane, if you dislike the trouble yourself.
- I dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done.
- And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
- And may I ask said Elizabeth; but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.
- Complied with!
- I am only ashamed of his asking so little.
- And they _must_ marry!
- Yet he is _such_ a man!
- Yes, yes, they must marry.
- There is nothing else to be done.
- My uncle!
- That is very true, said Elizabeth; though it had not occurred to me before.
- His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
- Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.
- A small sum could not do all this.
- No, said her father; Wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten
  thousand pounds.
- I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.
- Ten thousand pounds!
- Heaven forbid!
- How is half such a sum to be repaid?
- Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the
  breakfast-room.
- And they are really to be married!
- How strange this is!
- And for _this_ we are to be thankful.
- Oh, Lydia!
- He has children of his own, and may have more.
- How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?
- The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.
- By this time she is actually with them!
- If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!
- What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!
- His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right
  way of thinking.
- Their conduct has been such, replied Elizabeth, as neither you, nor I, nor anybody
  can ever forget.
- It is useless to talk of it.
- 'He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied: Just as you please.'
- May we take my uncles letter to read to her?
- Take whatever you like, and get away.
- Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together.
- 'Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore,
  do for all.'
- After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.
- Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself.
- To know that her daughter would be married was enough.
- She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of
  her misconduct.
- My dear, dear Lydia!
- This is delightful indeed!
- She will be married!
- I shall see her again!
- She will be married at sixteen!
- My good, kind brother!
- I knew how it would be.
- I knew he would manage everything!
- How I long to see her!
- But the clothes, the wedding clothes!
- I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.
- Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.
- Stay, stay, I will go myself.
- Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.
- I will put on my things in a moment.
- My dear, dear Lydia!
- How merry we shall be together when we meet!
- For we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a great measure to his
  kindness.
- We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.
- Well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?
- I am so happy!
- In a short time I shall have a daughter married.
- Mrs. Wickham!
- How well it sounds!
- And she was only sixteen last June.
- Other schemes, too, came into her head.
- And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.
- Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
- An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.
- Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?
- Here comes Hill!
- My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?
- Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.
- He now wished it more than ever.
- This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.
- Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children.
- It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.
- No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.
- I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics
  are dreadful.
- Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.
- Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.
- I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.
- A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm.
- He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the
  occasion.
- Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.
- She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.
- From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.
- She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.
- She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited
  by it.
- She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.
- His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her
  wishes.
- How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could
  not imagine.
- Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.
- It was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his marriage was
  fixed on.
- He has the promise of an ensigncy in General s regiment, now quartered in the North.
- It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.
- He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.
- Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.
- She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.Yours, etc.,
  E. GARDINER.
- But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it.
- She is so fond of Mrs. Forster, said she, it will be quite shocking to send her
  away!
- And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.
- The officers may not be so pleasant in General s regiment.
- The carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it by dinner-time.
- They came.
- The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them.
- Lydias voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into
  the room.
- Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.
- His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.
- The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.
- Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.
- Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.
- There was no want of discourse.
- They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.
- Good gracious!
- Her father lifted up his eyes.
- Jane was distressed.
- Elizabeth could bear it no longer.
- Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.
- Her ease and good spirits increased.
- Is not he a charming man?
- I am sure my sisters must all envy me.
- I only hope they may have half my good luck.
- They must all go to Brighton.
- That is the place to get husbands.
- What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.
- Very true; and if I had my will, we should.
- But my dear Lydia, I dont at all like your going such a way off.
- Must it be so?
- Oh, lord!
- I shall like it of all things.
- You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
- I should like it beyond anything!
- Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.
- Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.
- He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with
  him.
- You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
- Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?
- No really, replied Elizabeth; I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.
- You are so strange!
- But I must tell you how it went off.
- We were married, you know, at St. Clements, because Wickhams lodgings were in that
  parish.
- And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock.
- My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the
  church.
- Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!
- I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.
- If youll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there
  a fortnight.
- Not one party, or scheme, or anything.
- To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.
- And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.
- But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.
- Mr. Darcy!
- Oh, yes!he was to come there with Wickham, you know.
- But gracious me!
- I quite forgot!
- I ought not to have said a word about it.
- I promised them so faithfully!
- What will Wickham say?
- It was to be such a secret!
- If it was to be secret, said Jane, say not another word on the subject.
- You may depend upon my seeking no further.
- On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by
  running away.
- Mr. Darcy had been at her sisters wedding.
- Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed
  most improbable.
- Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she
  possibly could.
- Gracechurch Street, _Sept_.
- I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
- If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.
- But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
- On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected
  visitor.
- Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.
- His character was to speak for itself.
- If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.
- She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by
  letting lodgings.
- But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.
- At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.
- They were in  street.
- He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
- But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.
- She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify
  when.
- He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing
  to live on.
- Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.
- They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
- Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
  reasonable.
- On Saturday he came again.
- They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.
- 'It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off
  to Longbourn.'
- But our visitor was very obstinate.
- I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.
- He has been accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
- But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.
- You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.
- The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.
- I believe I have now told you every thing.
- Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.
- If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.
- Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.
- He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.
- His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
- I thought him very sly;he hardly ever mentioned your name.
- But slyness seems the fashion.
- A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.
- But I must write no more.
- The children have been wanting me this half hour.
- Yours, very sincerely, M. GARDINER.
- He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.
- Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.
- Brother-in-law of Wickham!
- Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.
- He had, to be sure, done much.
- She was ashamed to think how much.
- But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch
  of belief.
- They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him.
- For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.
- Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better
  of himself.
- She read over her aunts commendation of him again and again.
- It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.
- I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?
- I should be sorry indeed, if it were.
- _We_ were always good friends; and now we are better.
- Are the others coming out?
- I do not know.
- Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.
- And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually
  seen Pemberley.
- She replied in the affirmative.
- And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?
- Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.
- But of course she did not mention my name to you.
- Yes, she did.
- And what did she say?
- That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid hadnot turned out well.
- At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.
- Certainly, he replied, biting his lips.
- We passed each other several times.
- I wonder what he can be doing there.
- Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh, said Elizabeth.
- It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.
- Did you see him while you were at Lambton?
- I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.
- Yes; he introduced us to his sister.
- And do you like her?
- Very much.
- I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.
- When I last saw her, she was not very promising.
- I am very glad you liked her.
- I hope she will turn out well.
- I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.
- Did you go by the village of Kympton?
- I do not recollect that we did.
- I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.
- A most delightful place!Excellent Parsonage House!
- It would have suited me in every respect.
- How should you have liked making sermons?
- Exceedingly well.
- I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have
  been nothing.
- One ought not to repine;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!
- The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!
- But it was not to be.
- Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?
- You have.
- Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember.
- You did!
- You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.
- Do not let us quarrel about the past.
- In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.
- Oh, lord!
- I dont know.
- Not these two or three years, perhaps.
- Write to me very often, my dear.
- As often as I can.
- But you know married women have never much time for writing.
- My sisters may write to _me_.
- They will have nothing else to do.
- Mr. Wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes.
- He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
- He is as fine a fellow, said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house,
  as ever I saw.
- He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.
- I am prodigiously proud of him.
- I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.
- The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
- I often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends.
- One seems so forlorn without them.
- This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter, said Elizabeth.
- It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.
- It is no such thing.
- If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.
- Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.
- She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.
- Well, so much the better.
- Not that I care about it, though.
- He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again.
- But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.
- And who knows what _may_ happen?
- But that is nothing to us.
- You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.
- And so, is it quite certain he is coming?
- He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.
- Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.
- But dont imagine it was from any silly cause.
- I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.
- I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.
- I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.
- Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other peoples remarks.
- Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.
- I _will_ leave him to himself.
- They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.
- As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear, said Mrs. Bennet, you will wait on him
  of course.
- No, no.
- But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fools errand again.
- Tis an _etiquette_ I despise, said he.
- If he wants our society, let him seek it.
- He knows where we live.
- Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.
- But, however, that shant prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.
- We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.
- That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
  him.
- My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer
  from what she says.
- Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!
- I wish I could say anything to comfort you, replied Elizabeth; but it is wholly
  out of my power.
- Mr. Bingley arrived.
- Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.
- There is a gentleman with him, mamma, said Kitty; who can it be?
- Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.
- Mr. whats-his-name.
- That tall, proud man.
- Good gracious!
- Mr. Darcy!and so it does, I vow.
- Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.
- Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.
- But she would not be secure.
- Let me first see how he behaves, said she; it will then be early enough for expectation.
- Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.
- She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.
- But, perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle
  and aunt.
- It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
- There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.
- More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly
  expressed.
- She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.
- Could I expect it to be otherwise!
- Yet why did he come?
- She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.
- It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away, said Mrs. Bennet.
- He readily agreed to it.
- I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
- A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.
- Miss Lucas is married and settled.
- And one of my own daughters.
- I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.
- It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought
  to be.
- It was only said, Lately, George Wickham, Esq.
- Did you see it?
- Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.
- Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.
- How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
- Thank Heaven!
- A few weeks, he believed.
- I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the
  covies for you.
- Elizabeths misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!
- Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!
- Let me never see either one or the other again!
- But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.
- They then went away.
- Mr. Darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her.
- Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she, did he come
  at all?
- She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
- If he fears me, why come hither?
- If he no longer cares for me, why silent?
- Teasing, teasing, man!
- I will think no more about him.
- Now, said she, that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.
- I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.
- I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.
- Yes, very indifferent indeed, said Elizabeth, laughingly.
- Oh, Jane, take care.
- My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?
- I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
- Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by
  herself.
- He placed himself by her.
- Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
- It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful
  humour.
- Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.
- He was on one side of her mother.
- If he does not come to me, _then_, said she, I shall give him up for ever.
- The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes;
  but, alas!
- We want none of them; do we?
- Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.
- A man who has once been refused!
- How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?
- There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!
- Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.
- And quite alone?
- Have all her friends left her?
- Mrs. Annesley is with her.
- The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.
- She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
- Well girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, What say you to the
  day?
- I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.
- The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.
- The venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch.
- And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.
- Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.
- And what do you think she said besides?
- Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.
- She did indeed.
- It has been a very agreeable day, said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.
- The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.
- I hope we may often meet again.
- Elizabeth smiled.
- Lizzy, you must not do so.
- You must not suspect me.
- It mortifies me.
- How hard it is in some cases to be believed!
- And how impossible in others!
- But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?
- That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.
- We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
- Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante.
- A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.
- His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days
  time.
- He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.
- Next time you call, said she, I hope we shall be more lucky.
- He should be particularly happy at any time, etc.
- ; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
  them.
- Can you come to-morrow?
- Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted
  with alacrity.
- He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed.
- He is comeMr.
- Bingley is come.
- He is, indeed.
- Make haste, make haste.
- Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.
- Never mind Miss Lizzys hair.
- Come be quick, be quick!
- Where is your sash, my dear?
- But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without
  one of her sisters.
- The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening.
- What do you keep winking at me for?
- What am I to do?
- Nothing child, nothing.
- I did not wink at you.
- Elizabeth was forced to go.
- We may as well leave them by themselves you know; said her mother, as soon as she
  was in the hall.
- Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room.
- Mrs. Bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual.
- Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.
- After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.
- The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.
- _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought was still worse.
- Tis too much!
- I do not deserve it.
- Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.
- I must go instantly to my mother; she cried.
- He is gone to my father already.
- Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
  family!
- And this, said she, is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection!
- Where is your sister?
- With my mother up stairs.
- She will be down in a moment, I dare say.
- He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection
  of a sister.
- Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.
- Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.
- You will be a very happy woman.
- Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
- I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.
- Your tempers are by no means unlike.
- I hope not so.
- Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _me_.
- Exceed their income!
- My dear Mr. Bennet, cried his wife, what are you talking of?
- Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.
- Then addressing her daughter, Oh!
- I am sure I shant get a wink of sleep all night.
- I knew how it would be.
- I always said it must be so, at last.
- I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!
- Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.
- Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.
- At that moment, she cared for no other.
- I had not believed it possible.
- I suspected as much, replied Elizabeth.
- But how did he account for it?
- It must have been his sisters doing.
- That is the most unforgiving speech, said Elizabeth, that I ever heard you utter.
- Good girl!
- It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingleys pretended regard.
- He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.
- I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!
- Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!
- If I could but see you as happy!
- If there were but such another man for you!
- If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.
- Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.
- The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.
- It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
- That lady, I suppose, is your mother.
- Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
- And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.
- Yes, madam, said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
- She is my youngest girl but one.
- You have a very small park here, returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.
- Yes, very well.
- I saw them the night before last.
- But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
- I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.
- Go, my dear, cried her mother, and show her ladyship about the different walks.
- I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.
- Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was
  in it.
- How could I ever think her like her nephew?
- Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.
- Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
- Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.
- I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.
- But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.
- A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.
- What could your ladyship propose by it?
- At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.
- Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?
- Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?
- Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?
- I never heard that it was.
- And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?
- I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
- _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.
- This is not to be borne.
- Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.
- Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?
- Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
- It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.
- You may have drawn him in.
- If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.
- Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?
- I have not been accustomed to such language as this.
- Let me be rightly understood.
- This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.
- No, never.
- Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.
- Now what have you to say?
- Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer
  to me.
- From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.
- It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers.
- Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?
- To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?
- Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?
- Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?
- Yes, and I had heard it before.
- But what is that to me?
- You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.
- Its completion depended on others.
- And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?
- Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
- You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
- Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any
  of us.
- These are heavy misfortunes, replied Elizabeth.
- Obstinate, headstrong girl!
- I am ashamed of you!
- Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?
- Is nothing due to me on that score?
- Let us sit down.
- I have not been used to submit to any persons whims.
- I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.
- I will not be interrupted.
- Hear me in silence.
- My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.
- Their fortune on both sides is splendid.
- The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.
- Is this to be endured!
- But it must not, shall not be.
- In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
- He is a gentleman; I am a gentlemans daughter; so far we are equal.
- You _are_ a gentlemans daughter.
- But who was your mother?
- Who are your uncles and aunts?
- Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.
- Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?
- Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
- And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?
- I will make no promise of the kind.
- Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.
- I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.
- But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.
- I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.
- And I certainly _never_ shall give it.
- I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
- I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.
- Not so hasty, if you please.
- I have by no means done.
- To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.
- I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement.
- And is _such_ a girl to be my nephews sister?
- Is _her_ husband, who is the son of his late fathers steward, to be his brother?
- Heaven and earth!of what are you thinking?
- Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
- You can _now_ have nothing further to say, she resentfully answered.
- You have insulted me in every possible method.
- I must beg to return to the house.
- And she rose as she spoke.
- Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.
- Her ladyship was highly incensed.
- You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
- Unfeeling, selfish girl!
- Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of
  everybody?
- Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.
- You know my sentiments.
- You are then resolved to have him?
- I have said no such thing.
- It is well.
- You refuse, then, to oblige me.
- You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.
- No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.
- And this is your real opinion!
- This is your final resolve!
- Very well.
- I shall now know how to act.
- Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.
- I came to try you.
- I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.
- I send no compliments to your mother.
- You deserve no such attention.
- I am most seriously displeased.
- She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.
- She did not choose it, said her daughter, she would go.
- She is a very fine-looking woman!
- I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?
- It was a rational scheme, to be sure!
- In that case he would return no more.
- I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.
- Lizzy, said he, I was going to look for you; come into my room.
- She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.
- He then said, I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.
- As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.
- I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.
- Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.
- This letter is from Mr. Collins.
- From Mr. Collins!
- Something very much to the purpose of course.
- I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.
- Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?
- Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?
- 'But now it comes out: My motive for cautioning you is as follows.'
- Darcy_, you see, is the man!
- Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.
- It is admirable!
- Elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry, but could only force one most
  reluctant smile.
- Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.
- Are you not diverted?
- Pray read on.
- _That_ is his notion of Christian forgiveness!
- But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.
- You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle
  report.
- For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in
  our turn?
- But it is so strange!
- Yes_that_ is what makes it amusing.
- Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collinss correspondence for
  any consideration.
- And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?
- Did she call to refuse her consent?
- Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were
  not.
- It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.
- It was agreed to.
- Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.
- They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.
- I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.
- Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude
  to express.
- I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.
- You must not blame my aunt.
- If you _will_ thank me, he replied, let it be for yourself alone.
- But your _family_ owe me nothing.
- Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of _you_.
- Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.
- After a short pause, her companion added, You are too generous to trifle with me.
- If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
- They walked on, without knowing in what direction.
- There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other
  objects.
- But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
- It taught me to hope, said he, as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.
- What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?
- It was unpardonable.
- I cannot think of it without abhorrence.
- We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening, said
  Elizabeth.
- I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.
- Those were your words.
- I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.
- I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.
- I can easily believe it.
- You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.
- These recollections will not do at all.
- I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.
- Darcy mentioned his letter.
- Did it, said he, did it soon make you think better of me?
- Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?
- I knew, said he, that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.
- I hope you have destroyed the letter.
- I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.
- The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.
- The adieu is charity itself.
- But think no more of the letter.
- You must learn some of my philosophy.
- Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.
- I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.
- But with _me_, it is not so.
- Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.
- I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.
- As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.
- I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
- What do I not owe you!
- You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
- By you, I was properly humbled.
- I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
- You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy
  of being pleased.
- Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?
- Indeed I had.
- What will you think of my vanity?
- I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.
- My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.
- I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.
- How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?
- Hate you!
- I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.
- I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley.
- You blamed me for coming?
- No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.
- Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
- What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!
- Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest
  information of it.
- I must ask whether you were surprised?
- Not at all.
- When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.
- That is to say, you had given your permission.
- I guessed as much.
- And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the
  case.
- His surprise was great.
- He had never had the slightest suspicion.
- Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.
- From the former.
- And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.
- It did.
- Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.
- I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended
  him.
- He was angry.
- He has heartily forgiven me now.
- She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too
  early to begin.
- In the hall they parted.
- My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?
- She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond
  her own knowledge.
- She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion
  of the truth.
- The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
- The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
- At night she opened her heart to Jane.
- You are joking, Lizzy.
- This cannot be!engaged to Mr. Darcy!
- No, no, you shall not deceive me.
- I know it to be impossible.
- This is a wretched beginning indeed!
- My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you
  do not.
- Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.
- I speak nothing but the truth.
- He still loves me, and we are engaged.
- Jane looked at her doubtingly.
- Oh, Lizzy!
- I know how much you dislike him.
- You know nothing of the matter.
- _That_ is all to be forgot.
- Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.
- But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.
- This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.
- Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.
- Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.
- Good Heaven!
- Yet now I must believe you, cried Jane.
- My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldI do congratulate youbut are you certain?
- There can be no doubt of that.
- It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.
- But are you pleased, Jane?
- Shall you like to have such a brother?
- Very, very much.
- Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.
- But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.
- And do you really love him quite well enough?
- Oh, Lizzy!
- Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?
- Oh, yes!
- You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all.
- What do you mean?
- Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.
- I am afraid you will be angry.
- My dearest sister, now _be_ serious.
- I want to talk very seriously.
- Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.
- Will you tell me how long you have loved him?
- It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
- But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.
- When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.
- Now I am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as myself.
- I always had a value for him.
- But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.
- How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!
- I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.
- Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.
- But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydias marriage.
- All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.
- Good gracious!
- What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?
- What shall we do with him?
- Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleys way.
- I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty, said Mrs. Bennet, to walk to Oakham Mount
  this morning.
- It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.
- Wont it, Kitty?
- Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.
- Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth
  silently consented.
- So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.
- Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers.
- She was gone directly.
- Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
- Lizzy, said he, what are you doing?
- Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?
- Have not you always hated him?
- Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.
- He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than
  Jane.
- But will they make you happy?
- Have you any other objection, said Elizabeth, than your belief of my indifference?
- None at all.
- I do, I do like him, she replied, with tears in her eyes, I love him.
- Indeed he has no improper pride.
- He is perfectly amiable.
- You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
  such terms.
- Lizzy, said her father, I have given him my consent.
- I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.
- But let me advise you to think better of it.
- I know your disposition, Lizzy.
- Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.
- You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.
- My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner
  in life.
- You know not what you are about.
- Well, my dear, said he, when she ceased speaking, I have no more to say.
- If this be the case, he deserves you.
- I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.
- He heard her with astonishment.
- This is an evening of wonders, indeed!
- So much the better.
- It will save me a world of trouble and economy.
- Good gracious!
- Lord bless me!
- Mr. Darcy!
- Who would have thought it!
- And is it really true?
- What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!
- Janes is nothing to itnothing at all.
- I am so pleasedso happy.
- Such a charming man!so handsome!
- I hope he will overlook it.
- Dear, dear Lizzy.
- A house in town!
- Every thing that is charming!
- Three daughters married!
- Ten thousand a year!
- Oh, Lord!
- What will become of me.
- I shall go distracted.
- But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.
- My dearest child, she cried, I can think of nothing else!
- Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!
- Tis as good as a Lord!
- And a special licence.
- You must and shall be married by a special licence.
- I admire all my three sons-in-law highly, said he.
- Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite
  as well as Janes.
- How could you begin?
- I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the
  foundation.
- It is too long ago.
- I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.
- Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?
- For the liveliness of your mind, I did.
- You may as well call it impertinence at once.
- It was very little less.
- The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.
- I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.
- To be sure, you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall
  in love.
- Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?
- Dearest Jane!
- But make a virtue of it by all means.
- What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?
- Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?
- Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.
- But I was embarrassed.
- And so was I.
- You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.
- A man who had felt less, might.
- But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.
- I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!
- My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
- This will never do.
- You need not distress yourself.
- The moral will be perfectly fair.
- Lady Catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing
  all my doubts.
- I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your
  gratitude.
- I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours.
- My aunts intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every
  thing.
- Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she
  loves to be of use.
- But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?
- Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
- Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?
- I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.
- But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
  directly.
- But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.
- You supposed more than really existed.
- You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in
  your last.
- I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.
- How could I be so silly as to wish it!
- Your idea of the ponies is delightful.
- We will go round the Park every day.
- I am the happiest creature in the world.
- Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.
- I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.
- Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me.
- You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
- Yours, etc.
- Dear Sir, I must trouble you once more for congratulations.
- Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.
- Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
- But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.
- He has more to give.
- Yours sincerely, etc.
- The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.
- He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.
- If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
- Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make
  her more elegant.
- He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
- Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
- Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two
  elder sisters.
- In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.
- As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage
  of her sisters.
- 'The letter was to this effect: My dear Lizzy, I wish you joy.'
- If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.
- Yours, etc.
- They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.
- Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.
- With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
