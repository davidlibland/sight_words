- It was careening from side to side on the narrow road.
- '"He''ll hit us!'
- We'd better climb this hillside- and fast!"
- Frank exclaimed, as the boys brought their motorcycles to a screeching halt and
  leaped off.
- '"On the double!"'
- Joe cried out as they started up the steep embankment.
- The boys expected the car to turn over, but it held the dusty ground and sped off
  out of sight.
- '"Let''s get away from here before the crazy guy comes back.'
- That's a dead-end road, you know."
- They rode in silence for a while, gazing at the scene ahead.
- On their right an embankment of tumbled rocks and boulders sloped steeply to the
  water below.
- From the opposite side rose a jagged cliff.
- The little-traveled road was winding, and just wide enough for two cars to pass.
- '"Boy, I''d hate to fall off the edge of this road," Frank remarked.'
- '"It''s a hundred-foot drop."'
- '"That''s right," Joe agreed.'
- '"We''d sure be smashed to bits before we ever got to the bottom."'
- Then he smiled.
- '"Watch your step, Frank, or Dad''s papers won''t get delivered."'
- '"Why not?"'
- Joe replied with a broad grin.
- '"Isn''t he one of the most famous private detectives in the country?'
- And aren't we bright too?"
- Then, becoming serious, he added, "I wish we could solve a mystery on our own, though."
- Eighteen-year-old Frank was tall and dark.
- Joe, a year younger, was blond with blue eyes.
- They were the only children of Fenton and Laura Hardy.
- The boys took the next curve neatly and started up a long, steep slope.
- Here the road was a mere ribbon and badly in need of repair.
- '"Better road from there into Willowville."'
- They took a moment to glance back.
- '"Looks like that same guy we saw before!"'
- Joe burst out.
- '"Good night!"'
- At once the Hardys stopped and pulled as close to the edge as they dared.
- Frank and Joe hopped off and stood poised to leap out of danger again if necessary.
- The car hurtled toward them like a shot.
- That was close!"
- Frank gasped.
- But they had noted that he was hatless and had a shock of red hair.
- Frank relaxed.
- The boys resumed their journey.
- '"He''s probably halfway across the state by this time," Joe remarked.'
- '"Unless he''s in jail or over a cliff," Frank added.'
- When his brother returned, Joe suggested, "How about taking the other road back
  to Bayport?
- I don't crave going over that bumpy stretch again."
- '"Suits me.'
- We can stop off at Chet's."
- Chet Morton, who was a school chum of the Hardy boys, lived on a farm about a mile
  out of Bayport.
- The pride of Chet's life was a bright yellow jalopy which he had named Queen.
- He worked on it daily to "soup up" the engine.
- That crazy driver or somebody else had a crack-up!"
- Among the tall bushes was an overturned blue sedan.
- The car was a total wreck, and lay wheels upward, a mass of tangled junk.
- '"We''d better see if there''s anyone underneath," Joe cried out.'
- The boys made their way down the culvert, their hearts pounding.
- What would they find?
- A close look into the sedan and in the immediate vicinity proved that there was
  no victim around.
- '"Joe, it''s still warm," he said.'
- '"The accident occurred a short while ago.'
- Now I'm sure this is the red-haired driver's car."
- '"But what about him?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Is he alive?'
- Did somebody rescue him, or what happened?"
- Frank shrugged.
- '"One thing I can tell you.'
- Either he or somebody else removed the license plates to avoid identification."
- The brothers were completely puzzled by the whole affair.
- When they drove up the lane they saw Chet at the barnyard gate.
- '"Hi, fella!"'
- Joe called.
- Chet hurried down the lane to meet them.
- He was a plump boy who loved to eat and was rarely without an apple or a pocket
  of cookies.
- His round, freckled face usually wore a smile.
- But today the Hardys sensed something was wrong.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"I''m in trouble," Chet replied.'
- '"You''re just in time to help me.'
- Did you meet a fellow driving the Queen?"
- Frank and Joe looked at each other blankly.
- '"Your car?'
- No, we haven't seen it," said Joe.
- '"What''s happened?"'
- '"It''s been stolen!"'
- I just came out to the garage to get the Queen and she was gone," Chet answered
  mournfully.
- '"Wasn''t the car locked?"'
- '"That''s the strange part of it.'
- She was locked, although the garage door was open.
- I can't see how anyone got away with it."
- '"A professional job," Frank commented.'
- '"Auto thieves always carry scores of keys with them.'
- Chet, have you any idea when this happened?"
- '"Not more than fifteen minutes ago, because that''s when I came home with the car."'
- '"We''re wasting time!"'
- Joe cried out.
- '"Let''s chase that thief!"'
- '"But I don''t know which way he went," Chet protested.'
- '"We didn''t meet him, so he must have gone in the other direction," Frank reasoned.'
- '"Climb on behind me, Chet," Joe urged.'
- '"The Queen can''t go as fast as our motorcycles.'
- We'll catch her in no time!"
- '"Maybe it has stalled by this time."'
- '"The Queen''s pretty well known around Bay-port," Frank remarked.'
- '"We should meet someone who saw it."'
- '"Seems strange to me," said Joe, "that a thief would take a car like that.'
- Auto thieves usually take cars of a standard make and color.
- They're easier to get rid of."
- '"It''s possible," Frank suggested, "that the thief didn''t steal the car to sell
  it.'
- Maybe, for some reason, he was making a fast getaway and he'll abandon it."
- Chet exclaimed, pointing to a truck garden where several men were hoeing cabbage
  plants.
- '"Maybe they saw the Queen."'
- '"I''ll ask them," Frank offered, and brought his motorcycle to a stop.'
- '"Did you see a yellow jalopy go by here within the past hour?"'
- Frank asked him.
- The lanky old farmer leaned on his hoe and put a hand to one ear.
- '"Did you see a fellow pass along here in a bright yellow car?"'
- Frank repeated in a louder tone.
- The farmer called to his companions.
- '"Lad here wants to know if we saw a jalopy come by," he said slowly.'
- The other three farm hands, all rather elderly men, did not answer at once.
- Instead, they laid down their hoes and the plug of tobacco was duly passed around
  the group.
- Frank grit his teeth.
- '"Please hurry up and answer.'
- The car was stolen.
- We're trying to find the thief!"
- '"That so?"'
- '"A hot rod, eh?"'
- A bright yellow one," Frank replied.
- Another of the workers removed his hat and mopped his brow.
- '"Seems to me," he drawled, "I did see a car come by here a while ago."'
- '"A yellow car?"'
- '"No-''twarn''t yeller, come to think of it.'
- I guess, anyhow, it was a delivery truck, if I remember rightly."
- Frank strove to conceal his impatience.
- '"Please, did any of you-?"'
- '"Was it a brand-new car, real shiny?"'
- '"No, it was an old car, but it was painted bright yellow," Frank explained.'
- '"My nephew had one of them things," the farmer remarked.'
- '"Never thought they was safe, myself."'
- '"I don''t agree with you," still another man spoke up.'
- '"All boys like cars and you might as well let ''em have one they can work on themselves."'
- '"You''re all wrong!"'
- '"Let the boys work on the farm truck.'
- That way they won't get into mischief!"
- He gave a cackling sort of laugh.
- '"Well, son, I guess we ain''t been much help to you.'
- Hope you find the critter that stole your hot rod."
- '"Thanks," said Frank, and joined the other boys.'
- '"No luck.'
- Let's go!"
- As they approached Bayport, the trio saw a girl walking along the road ahead of
  them.
- Frank often dated Callie and liked her better than any girl he knew.
- The boys brought their motorcycles to a stop beside pretty, brown-eyed Callie.
- Under one arm she was carrying a slightly battered package.
- She looked vexed.
- '"Hi, Callie!'
- What's the matter?"
- Frank asked.
- '"You look as if your last friend had gone off in a moon rocket."'
- Callie gave a mischievous smile.
- '"How could I think that with you three friends showing up?'
- Or are you about to take off?"
- Then her smile faded and she held out the damaged package.
- '"Look at that!"'
- '"It''s your fault, Chet Morton!"'
- The stout boy gulped.
- '"M-my fault?'
- How do you figure that?"
- '"Well, dear old Mrs. Wills down the road is ill, so I baked her a cake."'
- '"Lucky Mrs. Wills," Joe broke in.'
- '"Callie, I''m feeling terribly ill." Callie ignored him.'
- I'm afraid my cake is ruined!"
- '"What man?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"The one Chet lent his car to."'
- '"Callie, that''s the man we''re looking for!"'
- Frank exclaimed.
- '"Chet didn''t lend him the car.'
- He stole it!"
- '"Chet, that''s a shame."'
- '"Was he heading for Bayport?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Yes, and at the speed he was making the poor Queen travel, you''ll never catch
  him."'
- Chet groaned.
- '"I just remembered that the gas gauge wasn''t working.'
- I guess the car had more gas in it than I thought.
- No telling where that guy may take my Queen."
- '"We''d better go to police headquarters," Frank suggested.'
- '"Callie, will you describe this man?"'
- '"All I saw," she answered, "was a blur, but the man did have red hair."'
- '"Red hair!"'
- Frank fairly shouted.
- '"Joe, do you think he could be the same man we saw?'
- The one who wrecked his own car?"
- Joe wagged his head.
- '"Miracles do happen.'
- Maybe he wasn't hurt very much and walked to Chet's house."
- '"And helped himself to my car!"'
- Chet added.
- Frank snapped his fingers.
- Maybe the wrecked car didn't belong to that fellow-" "You mean he'd stolen it, too!"
- Joe interrupted.
- '"Yes-which would make him even more desperate to get away."'
- '"Whatever are you boys talking about?"'
- Callie asked.
- '"I''ll phone you tonight and tell you," Frank promised.'
- '"Got to dash now."'
- The boys waved good-by to Callie and hurried into town.
- They went at once to Chief Ezra Collig, head of the Bayport police force.
- He was a tall, husky man, well known to Fenton Hardy and his two sons.
- When the boys went into his office they found the police chief talking with three
  excited men.
- One of these was Ike Harrity, the old ticket seller at the city ferryboat office.
- Another was Policeman Con Riley.
- The third was Oscar Smuff, a short, stout man.
- He was invariably seen wearing a checkered suit and a soft felt hat.
- Ike Harrity was frankly frightened.
- '"Just a minute," interrupted Chief Collig, turning to the newcomers.'
- '"What can I do for you boys?"'
- '"I came to report a theft," Chet spoke up.'
- '"My hot rod has been stolen."'
- '"Why, it was one of those crazy hot rods this fellow drove!"'
- Ike Harrity cried out.
- '"A yellow one!"'
- '"A clue!"'
- He immediately pulled a pencil and notebook from his pocket.
- '"My Queen!"'
- Chief Collig rapped on his desk for quiet and asked, "What's a queen got to do with
  all this?"
- Chet explained, then the chief related Harrity's story for him.
- '"A man drove up to the ferryboat office and tried to hold up Mr. Harrity.'
- But a passenger came into the office and the fellow ran away."
- '"I''ll send some men out there right now."'
- The chief pressed a buzzer and quickly relayed his orders.
- '"Did you notice the color of the man''s hair?"'
- Frank asked Mr. Harrity.
- Smuff interrupted.
- '"What''s that got to do with it?"'
- '"It may have a great deal to do with it," Frank replied.'
- '"What was the color of his hair, Mr.'
- '"Dark brown and short cropped."'
- Frank and Joe looked at each other, perplexed.
- '"You''re sure it wasn''t red?"'
- Joe asked.
- Chief Collig sat forward in his chair.
- '"What are you driving at, boys?'
- Have you some information about this man?"
- '"We were told," said Joe, "that the guy who stole Chet''s car had red hair.'
- A friend of ours saw him."
- '"Then he must have turned the jalopy over to someone else," Chief Collig concluded.'
- At this moment a short, nervous little man was ushered into the room.
- He was the passenger who had gone into the ferryboat office at the time of the attempted
  holdup.
- Chief Collig had sent for him.
- The newcomer introduced himself as Henry J.
- Brown of New York.
- '"What color was his hair?"'
- Frank asked eagerly.
- '"Did you notice?"'
- '"I can''t say I did," the man replied.'
- '"My eyes were focused on that gun.'
- Say, wait a minute!
- He had red hair.
- You couldn't miss it!
- I noticed it after he jumped into the car."
- Oscar Smuff looked bewildered.
- '"You say he had red hair."'
- The detective turned to Mr. Harrity.
- '"And you say he had dark hair.'
- Somethin' wrong somewhere!"
- He shook his head in puzzlement.
- The others were puzzled too.
- Frank asked Mr. Brown to tell once more just when he had noticed the red hair.
- '"After the fellow leaned down in the car and popped his head up again," the New
  Yorker replied.'
- Frank and Joe exchanged glances.
- The boys kept still-they didn't want any interference from Smuff in tracking down
  this clue.
- Harrity and Brown began to argue over the color of the thief's hair.
- Finally Chief Collig had to rap once more for order.
- '"I''ll send out an alarm for both this holdup man and for Chet''s car.'
- I guess that's all that can be done now."
- They were determined to pursue the case.
- '"We''ll talk with Dad tonight, Chet," Frank promised.'
- '"Maybe he''ll give us some leads."'
- '"I sure hope so, fellows," their friend replied as they climbed onto the motorcycles.'
- '"I''m not even scared to ride alongside you any more!"'
- '"You''re not scared!"'
- Frank pretended to take Joe seriously.
- '"What about me-riding with a daredevil like you?"'
- '"Well," Joe countered, "let''s just admit that we''re both pretty good!"'
- '"It sure was swell of Dad to let us have them," Joe continued.'
- '"Yes," Frank agreed.'
- '"And if we''re going to be detectives, we''ll get a lot of use out of them."'
- The boys started toward the house, passing the old-fashioned barn on the property.
- Right now, crocuses and miniature narcissi were sticking their heads through the
  light-green grass.
- '"Hello, Mother!"'
- Her sons kissed her affectionately and Joe asked, "Dad upstairs?"
- '"Yes, dear.'
- He's in his study."
- The study was Fenton Hardy's workshop.
- Walking into the study, Frank and Joe greeted their father.
- '"We''re reporting errand accomplished," Frank announced.'
- Mr. Hardy replied.
- Then he gave his sons a searching glance.
- '"I''d say your trip netted you more than just my errand."'
- '"Chet''s counting on us to find his car," Joe added.'
- Frank grinned.
- '"That is, unless the police find it first."'
- Mr. Hardy was silent for several seconds.
- Then he said, "Do you want a little advice?
- You know I never give it unless I'm asked for it."
- He chuckled.
- '"We''ll need a lot of help," Joe answered.'
- '"He may have bought at least one of them in Bay-port.'
- I suggest that you boys make the rounds of all shops selling wigs and see what you
  can find out."
- Let's go!"
- The two boys made a dash for the door, then both stopped short.
- They did not have the slightest idea where they were going!
- Sheepishly Joe asked, "Dad, do you know which stores sell wigs?"
- '"Why, Dad, I didn''t know you had all this information-" Joe began.'
- His father merely smiled.
- He thumbed through the heavy sheaf of papers, and pulled one out.
- '"Bayport," he read.'
- '"Well, three of these places can be eliminated at once.'
- They sell only women's hair pieces.
- Now let's see.
- Frank, get a paper and pencil.
- First there's Schwartz's Masquerade and Costume Shop.
- It's at 79 Renshaw Avenue.
- 'Then there''s Flint''s at Market and Pine, and one more: Ruben Brothers.'
- That's on Main Street just this side of the railroad."
- '"Schwartz''s is closest," Frank spoke up.'
- '"Let''s try him first, Joe."'
- Hopefully the boys dashed out to their motorcycles and hurried downtown.
- As they entered Schwartz's shop, a short, plump, smiling man came toward them.
- '"Our errand won''t take long," said Frank.'
- '"We''re sons of Fenton Hardy, the detective.'
- We'd like to know whether or not you recently sold a red wig to a man."
- Mr. Schwartz shook his head.
- '"I haven''t sold a red wig in months, or even rented one.'
- Everybody seems to want blond or brown or black lately.
- But you understand, I don't usually sell wigs at all.
- I rent 'em."
- '"I understand," said Frank.'
- '"We''re just trying to find out about a man who uses a red wig as a disguise.'
- We thought he might have bought or rented it here and that you would know his name."
- Mr. Schwartz leaned across the counter.
- '"This man you speak of-he sounds like a character.'
- It's just possible he may come in to get a wig from me.
- If he does, I'll be glad to let you know."
- The Hardys hoped that the dealer had suddenly remembered something important.
- This was not the case, however.
- '"Those folks at the factory don''t always get the sizes marked right," he said.'
- '"Would you be able to stay a few minutes and help me?'
- I'll be glad to pay you."
- '"Oh, we don''t want any money," Joe spoke up.'
- '"To tell you the truth, I''d like to see your costumes."'
- Mr. Schwartz locked the front door of his shop, then led the boys into a rear room.
- 'Suddenly Mr. Schwartz said: "Here''s a skeleton marked size thirty-eight.'
- Would one of you boys mind trying it on?"
- Frank picked up the costume, unzipped the back, and stepped into the skeleton outfit.
- It was tremendous on him and the ribs sagged ludicrously.
- '"Guess a fat man modeled for this," he remarked, holding the garment out to its
  full width.'
- At that moment there was a loud rap on the front door of the store.
- Mr. Schwartz made no move to answer it.
- '"I''m closed," he said.'
- '"Let him rap."'
- Suddenly Frank had an idea.
- He could vaguely see someone waiting to be admitted.
- But the stranger gave one look at the leaping, out-of-shape skeleton and disappeared
  in a flash.
- At the same moment Frank tripped and fell headlong.
- Mr. Schwartz and Joe, hearing the crash, rushed out to see what had happened.
- Frank, hopelessly tangled in the skeleton attire, was helped to his feet.
- '"But you sure scared him away in that outfit," Joe said, laughing.'
- '"He won''t be back!"'
- The boys stayed for over half an hour helping Mr. Schwartz, then said good-by and
  went home.
- '"Monday we''ll tackle those other two wig shops," said Frank.'
- '"We''ve been invited to stay to supper," Frank added.'
- '"But we promise not to get home late."'
- The Hardys picked up Callie Shaw, who also had been invited.
- Gaily she perched on the seat behind Frank.
- '"Hold on, Callie," Joe teased.'
- '"Frank''s a wild cyclist!"'
- Joe Hardy thought she was quite the nicest girl in Bayport High and dated her regularly.
- As dusk came on, the five young people gathered in the Mortons' kitchen to prepare
  supper.
- Chet, who loved to eat, was in charge, and doled out various jobs to the others.
- When he finished, Joe remarked, "And what are you going to do, big boy?"
- The stout youth grinned.
- '"I''m the official taster."'
- A howl went up from the others.
- '"No workee, no eatee," said Iola flatly.'
- Chet grinned.
- '"Oh, well, if you insist, I''ll make a little side dish for all of us.'
- How about Welsh rabbit?"
- '"You''re elected!"'
- The farmhouse kitchen was large and contained a group of windows in one corner.
- Here stood a large table, where the young people decided to eat.
- They had just sat down when the telephone rang.
- Chet got up and walked out in the hall to answer it.
- Within a minute he re-entered the kitchen, his eyes bulging.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- Iola asked quickly.
- '"I- I''ve been th-threatened!"'
- Chet replied.
- And if you don't lay off trying to find me or your car, you're going to get hurt!"
- '"This is getting serious!"'
- Callie and Iola had clutched their throats and were staring wild-eyed at Chet.
- Frank, about to speak, happened to glance out the window toward the barn.
- For an instant he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.
- But no!
- They were not.
- A figure was sneaking from the barn and down the lane toward the highway.
- '"Follow me!"'
- Joe struck out straight ahead and pressed his ear to the ground to listen for receding
  footsteps.
- He could hear none.
- '"Do you think he was a thief?"'
- Joe asked Chet.
- '"What would he steal?"'
- '"Search me," the stout boy replied.'
- '"Let''s take a look."'
- '"I believe he was carrying something, but I couldn''t see what it was," Frank revealed.'
- The barn door had not been closed yet for the night and the boys walked in.
- Chet turned on the lights and the searchers gazed around.
- Frank cried suddenly.
- He pointed to the floor below the telephone extension in the barn.
- There lay a man's gray wig.
- '"The intruder''s!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"It sure looks so," Frank agreed.'
- '"And something must have scared him.'
- In his hurry to get away he must have dropped this."
- Frank picked up the wig and examined it carefully for a clue.
- '"No identifying mark in it.'
- Say, I have an idea," he burst out.
- '"That man phoned you from here, Chet."'
- '"You mean he''s the one who threatened me?"'
- If you know how, you can call your own telephone number from an extension."
- '"That''s right."'
- Chet was wagging his head.
- '"You mean that guy bothered to come all the way here to use this phone to threaten
  me?'
- Both Hardys said they felt the man had not come specifically for that reason.
- There was another more important one.
- '"We must figure it out.'
- Chet, you ought to be able to answer that better than anybody else.
- What is there, or was there, in this barn to interest such a person?"
- The stout boy scratched his head and let his eyes wander around the building.
- '"It wouldn''t be any of the livestock," he said slowly.'
- '"And it couldn''t be hay or feed."'
- Suddenly Chet snapped his fingers.
- '"Maybe I have the answer.'
- Wait a minute, fellows."
- He disappeared from the barn and made a bee-line for the garage.
- Chet hurried inside but was back in a few seconds.
- '"I have it!"'
- '"That guy came here to get the spare tire for the jalopy."'
- '"The one you had is gone?"'
- Frank asked.
- Chet nodded.
- He suggested that perhaps the man was not too far away.
- He might be on some side road changing the tire.
- '"Let''s find out," he urged.'
- Although the Hardys felt that it would be a useless search, they agreed to go along.
- They got on their motorcycles, with Chet riding behind Joe.
- The boys went up one road and down another, covering the territory very thoroughly.
- They saw no parked car.
- '"No footprints, no tool marks, no treads."'
- '"That guy must have had somebody around to pick him up," Chet concluded with a
  sigh.'
- '"Cheer up, Chet," Frank said, as they walked back to the house.'
- '"That spare tire may turn out to be a clue in this case."'
- When the boys entered the kitchen again, they were met with anxious inquiries from
  Callie and Iola.
- '"What in the world were you doing-dashing out of here without a word?"'
- Callie asked in a shaking voice.
- '"Yes, what''s going on?'
- You had us frightened silly," Iola joined in.
- '"Calm down, girls," Frank said soothingly.'
- '"I saw a prowler, and we were looking for him, but all we found was this!"'
- He tossed the gray wig onto a chair in the hall.
- Suddenly there was a loud wail from Chet.
- '"My Welsh rabbit!'
- It's been standing so long it will be ruined!"
- Iola began to giggle.
- '"Oh, you men!"'
- '"Do you suppose Callie and I would let all that good cheese go to waste?'
- We kept that Welsh rabbit at just the right temperature and it isn't spoiled at
  all."
- Chet looked relieved, as he and the others took their places at the table.
- Frank and Joe asked Chet if they might take along the gray wig and examine it more
  thoroughly.
- There might be some kind of mark on it to indicate either the maker or the owner.
- Chet readily agreed.
- I'd like to watch your super-duper methods."
- '"Just for that, I will," said Frank.'
- He went to get the wig from the hall chair, and then laid it on the kitchen table.
- '"Nothing here," he said presently.'
- Frank could discover nothing.
- '"I''m afraid this isn''t going to help us much," he said in disgust.'
- '"But I''ll show it to the different wig men in town."'
- As he finished speaking the telephone rang and Iola went to answer it.
- Chet turned white and looked nervous.
- Was the caller the man who had threatened him?
- And what did he want?
- Presently Iola returned to the kitchen, a worried frown on her face.
- '"It''s a man for you, Chet.'
- He wouldn't give his name."
- Trembling visibly, Chet walked slowly to the telephone.
- The others followed and listened.
- '"Ye-yes, I''m Chet Morton.'
- N-no, I haven't got my car back."
- There was a long silence, as the person on the other end of the line spoke rapidly.
- '"B-but I haven''t any money," Chet said finally.'
- '"I_ Well, okay, I''ll let you know."'
- Chet hung up and wobbled to a nearby chair.
- The others bombarded him with questions.
- The stout boy took a deep breath, then said, "I can get my jalopy back.
- But the man wants a lot of money for the information as to where it is."
- '"Oh, I''m glad you''re going to get your car back!'
- Callie exclaimed.
- '"But I haven''t got any money," Chet groaned.'
- '"Who''s the man?"'
- Frank demanded.
- There was another long pause before Chet answered.
- Then, looking at the waiting group before him, he announced simply, "Smuff.
- Oscar Smuff !"
- His listeners gasped in astonishment.
- This was the last thing they expected to hear.
- The detective was selling information as to where Chet would find his missing jalopy!
- '"Why, that cheap so-and-so!"'
- Joe cried out angrily.
- Chet explained that Smuff had said he was not in business for his health.
- Frank shrugged.
- '"I suppose Smuff has a point there.'
- How much does he want for the information, Chet?"
- '"His fee is twenty-five dollars!"'
- After a long consultation it was decided that the young people would pool their
  resources.
- Chet put in a call to Smuff's home.
- As expected, the detective grumbled at the offer of ten dollars but finally accepted
  it.
- He said he would pick up the boys in half an hour and take them to the spot.
- About this time Mr. and Mrs. Morton returned home.
- He was in the real-estate business in Bay-port and ran the farm as a hobby.
- Mrs. Morton was an older edition of her daughter Iola and just as witty and lighthearted.
- But when she learned what had transpired and that her son had been threatened, she
  was worried.
- '"You boys must be very careful," Mrs. Morton advised.'
- '"From what I hear about Smuff, this red-haired thief could easily put one over
  on him.'
- So watch your step!"
- Chet promised that they would.
- '"Good luck!"'
- Callie called out, as Smuff beeped his horn outside the door.
- '"And don''t be too late.'
- I want to hear the news before I have to go home."
- Frank, Joe, and Chet found Smuff entirely uncommunicative about where they were
  going.
- He seemed to enjoy the role he was playing.
- '"I knew I''d be the one to break this case," he boasted.'
- '"But it won''t be long before I capture that fellow," he assured the boys.'
- Twenty minutes later Smuff pulled into the town of Ducksworth and drove straight
  to a used-car lot.
- Stopping, he announced, "Well, here we are.
- Get ready to fork over that money, Chet."
- Turning left, the detective finally paused before a bright red car.
- '"Here you are!"'
- '"My money, please."'
- The stout boy as well as the Hardys stared at the jalopy.
- There was no question but that it was the same make and model as Chet's.
- '"The thief thought he could disguise it by painting it red," Smuff explained.'
- '"Is that your guess?"'
- Frank asked quietly.
- Oscar Smuff frowned.
- '"How else could you figure it?"'
- '"Then there''ll be yellow paint under the red," Frank went on.'
- '"Let''s take a look to make sure."'
- It was evident that Smuff did not like this procedure.
- '"So you doubt me, eh?"'
- '"Anybody can get fooled," Frank told him.'
- '"Well, Chet, let''s operate on this car."'
- Oscar Smuff shouted.
- '"You be careful with that penknife!'
- The man who owns this place don't want you ruinin' his cars!"
- Frank Hardy looked up at the detective.
- '"I''ve watched my father scrape off flecks of paint many times.'
- The way he does it, you wouldn't know anybody had made a mark."
- Smuff grunted.
- '"But you''re not your father.'
- Easy there!"
- Taking a flashlight from his pocket, he trained it on the spot.
- '"Right," Frank agreed, eying Smuff intently.'
- The detective reddened.
- '"You fellows trying to tell me this isn''t Chefs jalopy?"'
- '"Well, I''m telling you it is, and I''m right!"'
- '"Oh, we haven''t said you''re wrong," Joe spoke up quickly.'
- Secretly he was hoping that this was Chet's car, but reason told him it was not.
- '"Well, maybe the thief put blue on and then red," said Smuff stubbornly.'
- Frank grinned.
- '"We''ll go a little deeper.'
- If the owner of this establishment objects, we'll pay for having the fenders painted."
- But though Frank went down through several layers of paint, he could not find any
  sign of yellow.
- All this time Chet had been walking round and round the car, looking intently at
  it inside and out.
- '"The Queen had a long, thin dent in the right rear fender," he said.'
- '"And that seat cushion by the door had a little split in it.'
- I don't think the thief would have bothered to fix them up."
- But Smuff was not giving up the money so easily.
- '"You haven''t proved a thing," he said.'
- '"The man who runs this place admitted that maybe this is a stolen car.'
- The fellow who sold it to him said he lived on a farm outside Bayport."
- The Hardys and Chet were taken aback for a moment by this information.
- But in a moment Frank said, "Let's go talk to the owner.
- We'll find out more about the person who brought this car in."
- The man who ran the used-car lot was very cooperative.
- He readily answered all questions the Hardys put to him.
- The bill of sale revealed that the former owner of the red jalopy was Melvin Schuster
  of Bayport.
- '"Why, we know him!"'
- Frank spoke up.
- '"He goes to Bayport High-at least, he did.'
- He and his family moved far away.
- That's probably why he sold his car."
- '"But Mr. Smuff said you suspected the car was stolen," Joe put in.'
- The used-car lot owner smiled.
- '"I''m afraid maybe Mr. Smuff put that idea in my head.'
- I did say that the person seemed in an awful hurry to get rid of the car and sold
  it very cheap.
- But at the time Mr. Schuster came in, I thought everything was on the level and
  bought his jalopy."
- Smuff was completely crestfallen.
- Without a word he started for his own car and the boys followed.
- As the Hardys and Chet walked into the Morton home, the two girls rushed forward.
- '"Did you find it?"'
- Iola asked eagerly.
- Chet sighed.
- '"Another one of Smuff''s bluffs," he said disgustedly.'
- He handed back the money which his friends had given to help pay the detective.
- Frank and Joe said good-by, went for their motorcycles, and took Callie home.
- Then they returned to their own house, showered, and went to bed.
- As soon as school was over the next day, they took the gray wig and visited Schwartz's
  shop.
- The owner assured them that the hair piece had not come from his store.
- '"It''s a very cheap one," the man said rather disdainfully.'
- Frank and Joe visited Flint's and Ruben Brothers' shops as well.
- Neither place had sold the gray wig.
- '"Today''s sleuthing was a complete washout," Joe reported that night to his father.'
- The famous detective smiled.
- '"Don''t be discouraged," he said.'
- '"I can tell you that one bit of success makes up for a hundred false trails."'
- '"That''ll give us hours and hours to work on the case," he said enthusiastically.'
- '"What do you suggest we do?"'
- Joe asked.
- Frank shrugged.
- Several ideas were brought up by the brothers, but one which Joe proposed was given
  preference.
- They would get hold of a large group of their friends.
- '"We''ll hunt in every possible hiding place," he stated.'
- All were students at Bayport High and prominent in various sports.
- The five boys were eager to co-operate.
- They agreed to assemble at the Hardy home at nine o'clock.
- In the meantime, Frank and Joe would lay out a plan of action.
- '"Take a map," he said, "with our house as a radius and cut pie-shaped sections.'
- I suggest that two boys work together."
- By nine o'clock his sons had mapped out the search in detail.
- The first recruit to arrive was Tony Prito, a lively boy with a good sense of humor.
- He was followed in a moment by Phil Cohen, a quiet, intelligent boy.
- '"Put us to work," said Tony.'
- '"I brought one of my father''s trucks that he isn''t going to use today."'
- Tony's father was in the contracting business.
- '"I can cover a lot of miles in it."'
- Frank suggested that Tony and Phil work together.
- He showed them the map, with Bayport as the center of a great circle, cut into four
  equal sections.
- '"Suppose you take from nine o''clock to twelve on this dial we''ve marked.'
- Mother has agreed to stay at home all day and act as clearing house for our reports.
- Call in every hour."
- '"Will do," Tony promised.'
- '"Come on, Phil.'
- Let's get going!"
- The two boys were just starting off when Biff and Jerry arrived at the Hardy home
  on motorcycles.
- Biff and Jerry were assigned to the section on the map designated six to nine o'clock.
- They were given further instructions on sleuthing, then started off on their quest.
- '"Where''s Chet?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked his sons.
- '"Wasn''t he going to help in the search?"'
- '"He probably overslept.'
- Chet's been known to do that," Frank said with a grin.
- '"He also might have taken time for a double breakfast," Joe suggested.'
- Mrs. Hardy, who had stepped to the front porch, called, "Here he comes now.
- Isn't that Mr. Morton's car?"
- '"Yes, it is," Frank replied.'
- Chet's father let him off in front of the Hardy home and the stout boy hurried to
  the porch.
- '"Good morning, Mrs. Hardy.'
- Good morning, Mr. Hardy.
- Hi, chums!"
- '"Sorry to be late.'
- My dad had a lot of phoning to do before he left.
- I was afraid if I'd tried to walk here, I wouldn't have arrived until tomorrow."
- At this point Mr. Hardy spoke up.
- '"As I said before, I think you boys should work in twos.'
- There are only three of you to take care of half the territory."
- The detective suddenly grinned boyishly.
- '"How about me teaming up with one of you?"'
- Frank and Joe looked at their dad in delight.
- '"You mean it?"'
- Frank cried out.
- '"I''ll choose you as my partner right now."'
- '"I have a further suggestion," the detective said.'
- '"It''s not going to take you fellows more than three hours to cover the area you''ve
  laid out.'
- And there's an additional section I think you might look into."
- '"What''s that?"'
- Joe inquired.
- '"Willow Grove.'
- That's a park area, but there's also a lot of tangled woodland to one side of it.
- Good place to hide a stolen car."
- '"That is, provided you haven''t found Chet''s jalopy by that time."'
- Mrs. Hardy spoke up.
- '"I''ll fix a nice lunch for all of you," she offered.'
- '"That sure would be swell," Chet said hastily.'
- '"You make grand picnic lunches, Mrs.'
- Mrs. Hardy said she would relay the news to the other boys when they phoned in.
- Chet and Joe set off on the Hardy boys' motorcycles, taking the twelve-to-three
  segment on the map.
- Then Mr. Hardy and Frank drove off for the three-to-six area.
- Hour after hour went by, with the searchers constantly on the alert.
- There was no sign of Chet's missing yellow jalopy.
- Finally at one o'clock Frank and his father returned to the Hardy home.
- '"Too bad we can''t go swimming," Tony remarked, "but this water''s pretty cold."'
- Quickly they unpacked the food and assembled around one of the park picnic tables.
- Chicken sandwiches!"
- Chet cried gleefully.
- During the meal the boys exchanged reports on their morning's sleuthing.
- All had tried hard but failed to find any trace of the missing car.
- '"Our work hasn''t ended," Frank reminded the others.'
- '"But I''m so stuffed I''m going to rest a while before I start out again."'
- All the other boys but Joe Hardy felt the same way and lay down on the grass for
  a nap.
- He searched for twenty minutes without finding a clue to any automobile.
- It appeared to be part of an abandoned roadway.
- Excitedly Joe pushed on through the dense undergrowth.
- It was in a low-lying part of the grove and the ground was wet.
- At one point it was quite muddy, and it was here that Joe saw something that aroused
  his curiosity.
- '"A tire!'
- '"No footprints, either.'
- I guess someone tossed this tire here."
- '"That tread," he thought excitedly, "looks familiar."'
- He gazed at it until he was sure, then dashed back to the other boys.
- '"I''ve found a clue!"'
- '"Come on, everybody!"'
- 'When they reached the spot, Chet examined the tire and exclaimed: "There''s no
  mistake about it!'
- This is one of the tires!
- When the thief put on the new one, he threw this away."
- '"Perhaps the Queen is still around," suggested Frank quickly.'
- '"It would be an ideal place," Chet agreed.'
- '"People coming to Willow Grove have to park at the gate, so nobody would come in
  here.'
- But this old road comes in from the main highway.
- Let's take a look, fellows."
- A scrutinizing search was begun along the abandoned road in the direction of the
  highway.
- A moment later Frank and Chet, in the lead, cried out simultaneously.
- '"Here''s a bypath!'
- And here are tire marks!"
- Frank exclaimed.
- To one side was a narrow roadway, almost overgrown with weeds and low bushes.
- It led from the abandoned road into the depths of the woods.
- Without hesitation Frank and Chet plunged into it.
- Presently the roadway widened out, then wound about a heavy clump of trees.
- It came to an end in a wide clearing.
- In the clearing stood Chet Morton's lost jalopy!
- '"My Queen!"'
- '"Her own license plates!"'
- His shout was heard by the rest of the boys, who came on a run.
- Chet's joy was boundless.
- He examined the car with minute care, while his chums crowded around.
- At last he straightened up with a smile of satisfaction.
- '"She hasn''t been damaged a bit.'
- All ready to run.
- The thief just hid the old bus in here and made a getaway.
- Come on, fellows, climb aboard.
- Free ride to the highway!"
- Before leaving, the Hardys examined footprints left by the thief.
- '"He wore sneakers," Frank observed.'
- Suddenly Chet swung open the door and looked on the floor.
- '"You mean he wore my sneakers.'
- They're gone."
- '"And carried his own shoes," Joe observed.'
- '"Very clever.'
- Well, that washes out one clue.
- Can't trace the man by his shoe prints."
- '"Let''s go!"'
- Chet urged.
- He jumped into the car and in a few seconds the engine roared.
- There was barely sufficient room in the clearing to permit him to turn the jalopy
  about.
- '"And I hope Smuff will be around," Chet gloated.'
- People were standing in little groups, gesticulating and talking earnestly.
- Presently the Hardys saw Oscar Smuff striding along with a portentous frown.
- Joe called out to him.
- '"What''s going on, detective?'
- You notice we found Chet's car."
- '"I''ve got something more important than stolen cars to worry- Hey, what''s that?"'
- Detective Smuff stared blankly, as the full import of the discovery filtered his
  consciousness.
- The boys waited for Smuff's praise, but he did not give it.
- Instead, he said, "I got a big mystery to solve.
- The Tower Mansion has been robbed!"
- '"Good night!"'
- Tower Mansion was one of the show places of Bayport.
- Years ago there had been many parties and dances in the mansion.
- They lived in the vast, lonely mansion at the present time.
- Hurd Applegate was a man about sixty, tall, and stooped.
- His life seemed to be devoted now to the collection of rare stamps.
- But a few years before he had built a new tower on the mansion, a duplicate of the
  original one.
- His sister Adelia was a maiden lady of uncertain years.
- Well-dressed women in Bayport were amused by her clothes.
- She dressed in clashing colors and unbecoming styles.
- '"Tell us about the theft," Joe begged Smuff.'
- But the detective waved his hand airily.
- '"You''ll have to find out yourselves," he retorted as he hurried off.'
- Frank and Joe called good-by to their friends and headed for home.
- As they arrived, the boys saw Hurd Applegate just leaving the house.
- The man tapped the steps with his cane as he came down them.
- When he heard the boys' motorcycles he gave them a piercing glance.
- '"Good day!"'
- The boys rushed into the house, eager to find out more about the robbery.
- In the front hallway they met their father.
- '"We heard the Tower Mansion has been robbed," said Joe.'
- Mr. Hardy nodded.
- Mr. Applegate was just here to tell me about it.
- He wants me to handle the case."
- '"How much was taken?"'
- Mr. Hardy smiled.
- '"Well, I don''t suppose it will do any harm to tell you.'
- The safe in the Applegate library was opened.
- The loss will be about forty thousand dollars, all in securities and jewels."
- '"What a haul!'
- When did it happen?"
- '"Either last night or this morning.'
- It was then that he discovered the theft."
- '"How was the safe opened?"'
- '"By using the combination.'
- I'm going up to the house in a few minutes.
- Mr. Applegate is to call for me."
- '"I''d like to go along," Joe said eagerly.'
- '"So would I," Frank declared.'
- Mr. Hardy looked at his sons and smiled.
- If Mr. Applegate doesn't object, you may come with me."
- A few minutes later a foreign-make, chauffeur-driven car drew up before the Hardy
  home.
- Mr. Applegate was seated in the rear, his chin resting on his cane.
- The three Hardys went outside.
- When the detective mentioned the boys' request, the man merely grunted assent and
  moved over.
- Frank and Joe stepped in after their father.
- The car headed toward Tower Mansion.
- '"I don''t really need a detective in this case!"'
- Hurd Applegate snapped.
- '"Don''t need one at all.'
- It's as clear as the nose on your face.
- I know who took the stuff.
- But I can't prove it."
- '"Whom do you suspect?"'
- Fenton Hardy asked.
- '"Only one man in the world could have taken the jewels and securities.'
- Henry Robinson-the caretaker.
- He's the man."
- The Hardy boys looked at each other in consternation.
- Henry Robinson, the caretaker of the Tower Mansion, was the father of one of their
  closest chums!
- Perry Robinson, nicknamed "Slim," was the son of the accused man!
- That his father should be blamed for the robbery seemed absurd to the Hardy boys.
- '"I don''t believe he''s guilty," Frank whispered.'
- '"Neither do I," returned his brother.'
- '"What makes you suspect Robinson?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked Hurd Applegate.
- '"He''s the only person besides my sister and me who ever saw that safe opened and
  closed.'
- He could have learned the combination if he'd kept his eyes and ears open, which
  I'm sure he did."
- '"Is that your only reason for suspecting him?"'
- This morning he paid off a nine-hundred-dollar note at the bank.
- And I know for a fact he didn't have more than one hundred dollars to his name a
  few days ago.
- Now where did he raise nine hundred dollars so suddenly?"
- '"Perhaps he has a good explanation," Mr. Hardy suggested.'
- '"Oh, he''ll have an explanation all right!"'
- '"But it will have to be a mighty good one to satisfy me."'
- Mr. Hardy and the two boys accompanied the eccentric man into the house.
- Mr. Hardy examined the open safe, then took a special magnifying glass from his
  pocket.
- With minute care he inspected the dial of the combination lock.
- Next he walked to each window and the door to examine them for fingerprints.
- At last he shook his head.
- '"A smooth job," he observed.'
- '"The thief must have worn gloves.'
- All the fingerprints in the room, Mr. Applegate, seem to be yours."
- '"No use looking for fingerprints or any other evidence!"'
- Mr. Applegate barked impatiently.
- '"It was Robinson, I tell you."'
- '"Perhaps it would be a good idea for me to ask him a few questions," Mr. Hardy
  advised.'
- Mr. Hardy glanced at the boys and suggested they wait in the hallway.
- '"It might prove less embarrassing to Mr. Robinson that way," he said in a low voice.'
- Frank and Joe readily withdrew.
- In the hall they met Mr. Robinson and his son Perry.
- The man was calm, but pale, and at the doorway he patted Slim on the shoulder.
- '"Don''t worry," he said.'
- '"Everything will be all right."'
- With that he entered the library.
- Slim turned to his two friends.
- '"It''s got to be!"'
- '"My dad is innocent!"'
- FRANK and Joe were determined to help their chum prove his father's innocence.
- They shared his conviction that Mr. Robinson was not guilty.
- '"Of course he''s innocent," Frank agreed.'
- '"He''ll be able to clear himself all right, Slim."'
- '"But things look pretty black right now," the boy said.'
- He was white-faced and shaken.
- '"Unless Mr. Hardy can catch the real thief, I''m afraid Dad will be blamed for
  the robbery."'
- '"Everybody knows your father is honest," said Joe consolingly.'
- '"He has been a faithful employee -even Mr. Applegate will have to admit that."'
- '"Which won''t help him much if he can''t clear himself of the charge.'
- And Dad admits that he did know the combination of the safe, although of course
  he'd never use it."
- '"He knew it?"'
- '"Dad learned the combination accidentally.'
- It was so simple one couldn't forget it.
- This was how it happened.
- One day when he was cleaning the library fireplace, he found a piece of paper with
  numbers on it.
- He studied them and decided they were the safe combination.
- Dad laid the paper on the desk.
- The window was open and he figured the breeze must have blown the paper to the floor."
- '"Does Mr. Applegate know that?"'
- '"Not yet.'
- But Dad is going to tell him now.
- He realizes it will look bad for him, but he's going to give Mr. Applegate the truth."
- From the library came the hum of voices.
- '"I didn''t do it!'
- I tell you I didn't take that money!"
- '"Then where did you get the nine hundred you paid on that note?"'
- '"Where did you get it?"'
- '"I''m not at liberty to tell you or anyone else."'
- '"Why not?"'
- '"I got the money honestly-that''s all I can say about it."'
- '"Oh, ho!"'
- '"You got the money honestly, yet you can''t tell me where it came from!'
- A pretty story!
- If you got the money honestly you shouldn't be ashamed to tell where it came from."
- '"I''m not ashamed.'
- I can only say again, I'm not at liberty to talk about it."
- '"Mighty funny thing that you should get nine hundred dollars so quickly.'
- You were pretty hard up last week, weren't you?
- Had to ask for an advance on your month's wages."
- '"That is true."'
- '"And then the day of this robbery you suddenly have nine hundred dollars that you
  can''t explain."'
- Mr. Hardy's calm voice broke in.
- '"I know it looks bad," replied the caretaker doggedly.'
- '"But I''ve made a promise I can''t break."'
- '"And you admit being familiar with the combination of the safe, too!"'
- '"I didn''t know that before.'
- Why didn't you tell me?"
- '"I didn''t consider it important."'
- '"And yet you come and tell me now!"'
- '"I have nothing to conceal.'
- If I had taken the securities and jewels I wouldn't be telling you that I knew the
  combination."
- '"Yes," agreed Mr. Hardy, "that''s a point in your favor, Mr.'
- '"Is it?"'
- '"Robinson''s just clever enough to think up a trick like that.'
- Very clever.
- But not clever enough.
- In a moment Mr. Applegate's voice continued, "Police station?
- Hello .
- Police station?
- This is Applegate speaking-Applegate-Hurd Applegate.
- Well, we've found our man in that robbery.
- Yes, Robinson.
- You thought so, eh?-So did I, but I wasn't sure.
- He has practically convicted himself by his own story.
- Yes, I want him arrested.
- You'll be up right away?
- '"You''re not going to have me arrested, Mr.'
- '"Why not?'
- You're the thief!"
- '"It might have been better to wait a while," Mr. Hardy interposed.'
- '"At least until there was more evidence."'
- '"What more evidence do we want, Mr. Hardy," the owner of Tower Mansion sneered.'
- '"I can''t return them!'
- I didn't take them!"
- Mr. Robinson defended himself.
- '"You''ll have plenty of time to think," Mr. Applegate declared.'
- '"You''ll be in the penitentiary a long time-a long time."'
- In the hallway the boys listened in growing excitement and dismay.
- The case had taken an abrupt and tragic turn.
- Slim looked as though he might collapse under the strain.
- '"My dad''s innocent," the boy muttered over and over again, clenching his fists.'
- '"I know he is.'
- They can't arrest him.
- He never stole anything in his life!"
- Frank patted his friend on the shoulder.
- '"Brace up, pal," he advised.'
- '"It looks discouraging just now, but I''m sure your father will be able to clear
  himself."'
- '"I- I''ll have to tell Mother," stammered Slim.'
- '"This will break her heart.'
- She was seated in a chair by the window, anxiously waiting.
- '"What news, son?"'
- Mrs. Robinson asked bravely, after she had greeted the Hardys.
- '"Bad, Mother."'
- '"They''re not-they''re not-arresting him?"'
- Perry nodded wordlessly.
- '"But they can''t!"'
- Tessie protested.
- '"Dad couldn''t do anything like that!'
- It's wrong-" Frank, looking at Mrs. Robinson, saw her suddenly slump over in a faint.
- He sprang forward and caught the woman in his arms as she was about to fall to the
  floor.
- Perry explained that at times undue excitement caused an "attack."
- '"I shouldn''t have told her about Dad," the boy chided himself.'
- '"She''d have to know it sooner or later," Joe said kindly.'
- In a moment Paula returned with the bottle of smelling salts and medicine.
- In a few moments the woman completely revived and apologized for having worried
  everyone.
- Joe agreed.
- '"He was a criminal-that much is certain.'
- He stole an automobile and he tried to hold up the ticket office, so why not another
  robbery?"
- '"Right, Joe.'
- I just realized that we never inspected Chet's car for any dues to the thief, so
  let's do it."
- Then, when Mrs. Morton picked up Chet and Iola, Frank and Joe went home with them.
- '"I''ll look under the seats," Joe offered.'
- '"And I''ll search the trunk compartment."'
- Frank walked to the back of the car and raised the cover.
- He began rooting under rags, papers, and discarded schoolbooks.
- Presently he gave a cry of victory.
- '"Here it is!'
- The best evidence in the world!"
- Joe and Chet rushed to his side as he held up a man's red wig.
- Frank said excitedly, "Maybe there's a clue in this hair piece!"
- An examination failed to reveal any, but Frank said he would like to show the wig
  to his father.
- He covered it with a handkerchief and put it carefully in an inner pocket.
- Chet drove the Hardys home.
- '"Dad, we''ve found a clue!"'
- Joe cried.
- Then he stepped back, embarrassed, as he realized there was someone else in the
  room.
- '"It''s only me," said Slim.'
- '"Don''t go."'
- '"Hi, Slim!"'
- '"Perry has been trying to shed a little more light on the Tower robbery," explained
  Mr, Hardy.'
- '"But what is this clue you''re talking about?"'
- '"It might concern the robbery," replied Frank.'
- '"It''s about the red-haired man."'
- He took the wig from his pocket and told where he had found it.
- Mr. Hardy's interest was kindled at once.
- '"This seems to link up a pretty good chain of evidence.'
- When he failed there, he tried another and more successful robbery at the Tower."
- '"Do you really think the wig might help us solve the Tower robbery?"'
- I didn't think anything of it at the time, and in the shock of Dad's arrest I forgot
  about it."
- '"Did you get a good look at him?'
- Could you describe him?"
- Frank asked.
- '"I''m afraid I can''t.'
- It was in the evening.
- I was sitting by a window, studying, and happened to look up.
- I saw this fellow moving about among the trees.
- Later, I heard one of the dogs barking in another part of the grounds.
- Shortly afterward, I saw someone running across the lawn.
- I thought he was just a tramp."
- '"Did he wear a hat or a cap?"'
- '"As near as I can remember, it was a cap.'
- His clothes were dark."
- '"And you couldn''t see his face?"'
- The detective thought deeply for a few moments.
- I feel they haven't enough evidence to warrant holding your father, Perry."
- '"Do you think you can have him released?"'
- '"I''m sure of it.'
- In fact, I believe Mr. Applegate is beginning to realize now that he made a mistake."
- '"It will be wonderful if we can have Dad back with us again," said Perry.'
- '"Of course things won''t be the same for him.'
- He'll be under a cloud of suspicion as long as this mystery isn't cleared up.
- I suppose Mr. Applegate won't employ him or anyone else."
- '"Wonder what''s up now?"'
- Frank was not slow in following.
- On the board was a large poster.
- The ink on it was scarcely dry.
- The reward was being offered by Hurd Apple-gate.
- '"Why, that must mean the charge against Mr. Robinson has been dropped!"'
- '"It looks like it.'
- Let's see if we can find Slim."
- '"A thousand dollars!"'
- '"That''s a lot of money, Joe."'
- '"I''ll say it is."'
- '"And there''s no reason why we haven''t as good a chance of earning it as anyone
  else."'
- But if we track him down we can get the money.
- It'll be a good sum to add to our college fund."
- '"Let''s go!'
- Say, there's Slim now."
- Perry Robinson was coming down the street toward them.
- '"Dad is free," he told them.'
- '"Thanks to your father, the charge has been dropped."'
- '"I''m sure glad to hear that!"'
- '"I see a reward is being offered."'
- '"Your father convinced Mr. Applegate that it must have been an outside job.'
- And the work of a professional thief.
- Chief Collig admitted there wasn't much evidence against Dad, so they let him go.
- It's a great relief.
- My mother and sisters were almost crazy with worry."
- '"No wonder," commented Frank.'
- '"What''s your father going to do now?"'
- '"I don''t know," Slim admitted.'
- '"Of course, we''ve had to move from the Tower Mansion estate.'
- So he dismissed him."
- '"That''s tough luck.'
- But your dad will be able to get another job somewhere," Frank said consolingly.
- '"I''m not so sure about that.'
- People aren't likely to employ a man who's been suspected of stealing.
- Dad tried two or three places this afternoon, but he was turned down."
- The Hardys were silent.
- They felt very sorry for the Robinsons and were determined to do what they could
  to help them.
- '"We''ve rented a small house just outside the city," Slim went on.'
- '"It''s cheap and the neighborhood is kind of bad, but we''ll have to get along."'
- Frank and Joe admired Slim.
- There was no false pride about him.
- He faced the facts as they came, and made the best of them.
- '"But if Dad doesn''t get a job, it will mean that I''ll have to go to work full
  time."'
- '"Why, Slim-you''d have to quit school!"'
- Joe cried out.
- '"I can''t help that.'
- I wouldn't want to, for you know I was trying for a scholarship.
- But-" The brothers realized how much it would mean to their chum if he had to leave
  school.
- Perry Robinson was an ambitious boy and one of the top ten in his class.
- Frank put an arm around Slim's shoulders.
- '"Chin up," he said with a warm smile.'
- '"Joe and I are going to plug away at this affair until we get to the bottom of
  it!"'
- '"It''s mighty good of you fellows," Slim said gratefully.'
- '"I won''t forget it in a hurry."'
- He tried to smile, but it was evident that the boy was deeply worried.
- When he walked away it was not with the light, carefree step which the Hardys associated
  with him.
- '"What''s the first move, Frank?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"We''d better get a full description of those jewels.'
- Perhaps the thief tried to pawn them.
- Let's try all the pawnshops and see what we can find out."
- '"Good idea, even if the police have already done it."'
- Frank grinned.
- Then he sobered.
- '"Do you think Applegate will give us a list?"'
- '"We won''t have to ask him.'
- Dad should have that information."
- '"Let''s find out right now."'
- When the boys returned home, they found their father waiting for them.
- '"I have news for you," he said.'
- '"Your theory about the wrecked auto being stolen has been confirmed.'
- Collig phoned just now and told me the true ownership had been traced by the engine
  number.
- Car belongs to a man over in Thornton."
- That's one more strike against the thief," Joe declared.
- Furthermore, I'll bet I can tell just what you're going to do."
- '"Make the rounds of the pawnshops to see if any of the jewels have been turned
  in."'
- The Hardy boys looked at each other in amazement.
- '"I might have guessed," said Frank.'
- Their father smiled.
- Here's a duplicate list if you want it, but you'll just be wasting time calling
  at the shops.
- All the dealers are on the lookout for the jewels."
- Mechanically, Frank took the list.
- '"And I thought it was such a bright idea!"'
- '"It is a bright idea.'
- But it has been used before.
- '"Well," said Joe gloomily, "I guess that plan is all shot to pieces.'
- Come on, Frank.
- We'll think of something else."
- '"Out for the reward?"'
- And we'll get it, too!"
- '"I hope you do.'
- But you can't ask me to help you any more than I've done.
- It's my case, too, remember.
- So from now on, you boys and I are rivals I" "It's a go!"
- '"More power to you!"'
- Mr. Hardy smiled and returned to his desk.
- There had been no lead to the gems or the bonds taken from Tower Mansion.
- When the boys left their father's study they went outside and sat on the back-porch
  steps.
- '"What shall we do now?"'
- '"I don''t know.'
- Dad sure took the wind out of our sails that time, didn't he?"
- '"I''ll say he did.'
- But it was just as well.
- He saved us a lot of trouble."
- '"Yes, we might have been going around in circles," Frank conceded.'
- Joe wagged his head.
- '"It looks as if Dad has the inside track on the case-in the city, anyway."'
- '"What have you got in mind?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"To concentrate on the country.'
- We started out to find the thief because he stole Chet's car.
- Let's start all over again from that point."
- You figure the guy may have left a clue by accident" "Exactly."
- They found none, but Joe pointed out six-inch circular marks at regular intervals.
- '"They''re just the size of a man''s stride," he remarked, "and I didn''t notice
  them before."'
- '"I didn''t either," said Frank.'
- '"Do you suppose that thief tied pads onto his shoes to keep him from making footprints?"'
- '"Let''s see where they lead."'
- The boys followed the circular marks through the thicket.
- They had not gone far when their eyes lighted up with excitement.
- '"Another due!"'
- Joe yelled.
- '"And this time a swell one!"'
- '"MAYBE," Frank said with a grin, "Dad will take us into his camp when he sees these!"'
- '"Just a minute," Joe spoke up.'
- '"I thought we were rivals now, and you and I have to solve this mystery alone to
  earn the reward."'
- Frank held up a man's battered felt hat and an old jacket.
- '"If these belong to that thief, I think we''ve earned the money already!"'
- He felt through the pockets of the jacket, but they were empty.
- '"No clue here," he said.'
- '"This hat has a label, though-New York City store," said Joe.'
- '"And the coat, too," Frank added.'
- '"Same shop.'
- Well, one thing is sure.
- If they do belong to the thief, he never meant to leave them.
- The labels are a dead giveaway."
- '"He must have been frightened off," Joe concluded.'
- '"What I''d like to know," Frank said, "is whether some hairs from that red wig
  may be in the hat."'
- Joe grinned.
- '"Bright boy."'
- Frank gazed at two short strands of red hair.
- They looked exactly like those in the wig which the boys had found.
- Joe sighed.
- '"I guess we''ll have to tell Dad about this.'
- He has the wig."
- Frank and Joe hurried home, clutching their precious clues firmly.
- Mr. Hardy was still in his study when his sons returned.
- The detective looked up, frankly surprised to see them home so soon.
- There was the suspicion of a twinkle in his eyes.
- More clues!"
- '"You''re really on the job."'
- '"You bet we have more clues!"'
- He told the boys' story and laid the hat and jacket on a table.
- '"We''re turning these over to you."'
- '"But I thought you two were working on this case as my rivals."'
- '"To tell the truth," said Frank, "we don''t know what to do with the due we''ve
  found.'
- It leads to New York City."
- And Joe and I don't have the wig."
- With a grin the detective went to his files and brought it out.
- '"Chief Collig left this here."'
- The strands of hair were compared and matched perfectly!
- '"You boys have certainly made fine progress," Mr. Hardy praised his sons.'
- He smiled.
- '"And since you have, I''ll let you in on a little secret.'
- Chief Collig asked me to see what I could figure out of the wig.
- He says there's no maker's name on it."
- '"And there isn''t?"'
- Joe asked.
- His father's eyes twinkled once more.
- '"I guess Collig''s assistants weren''t very thorough.'
- At any rate, I discovered there's an inner lining and on that is the maker's name.
- He's in New York City and I was just thinking about flying there to talk to him.
- Now you boys have given me a double incentive for going."
- Frank and Joe beamed with pleasure, then suddenly their faces clouded.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked them.
- Joe answered.
- '"It looks as if you''re going to solve the case all alone."'
- '"Nothing of the sort," the detective replied.'
- '"The person who bought the wig may not have given his name.'
- The same with the jacket."
- Frank and Joe brightened.
- '"Then the case is far from solved," Frank said.'
- '"All these are good leads, however," Mr. Hardy said.'
- '"There is always the chance that the store may not be far from where the suspect
  lives.'
- Though it's a slim chance, we can't afford to overlook anything.
- I'll take these articles to the city and see what I can do.
- It may mean everything and it may mean nothing.
- Don't be disappointed if I come back empty-handed.
- And don't be surprised if I come back with some valuable information."
- Mr. Hardy tossed the wig, coat, and hat into a bag that was standing open near his
  desk.
- '"Not much use starting now," he said, glancing at his watch.'
- '"But I''ll go to the city first thing in the morning.'
- In the meantime, you boys keep your eyes and ears open for more clues.
- The case isn't over yet by any means."
- '"That thief must be pretty smart," murmured Joe, after they had talked long into
  the night.'
- '"The smarter crooks are, the harder they fall," Frank replied.'
- '"If this fellow has any kind of a record, it won''t take long for Dad to run him
  down.'
- I've heard Dad say that there is no such thing as a clever crook.
- If he was really clever, he wouldn't be a crook at all."
- '"Yes, I guess there''s something in that, too.'
- But it shows that we're not up against any amateur.
- This fellow is a slippery customer."
- '"He''ll have to be mighty slippery from now on.'
- Once Dad has a few clues to work on he never lets up till he gets his man."
- '"And don''t forget us," said Joe, yawning.'
- With that the boys fell asleep.
- Their mother remarked, "I'll be so relieved when he gets back.
- So often these missions turn out to be dangerous."
- Mrs. Hardy refused to divulge another word.
- The boys went to school, but all through the morning could scarcely keep their minds
  on studies.
- They kept wondering how Fenton Hardy was faring on his quest in New York and what
  the surprise was.
- '"It''s no use," he said.'
- '"Dad can''t keep me in school any longer and it''s up to me to pitch in and help
  the family.'
- I'm to start work tomorrow at a supermarket."
- '"And you wanted to go to college!"'
- '"It''s a shame!"'
- '"Can''t be helped," replied Perry with a grimace.'
- '"I consider myself lucky to have stayed in school this long.'
- I'll have to give up all those college plans and settle down in the business world.
- There's one good thing about it-I'll have a chance to learn supermarket work from
  the ground up.
- I'm starting in the receiving department."
- He smiled.
- '"Perhaps in about fifty years I''ll be head of the firm!"'
- '"You''ll make good at whatever you tackle," Joe assured him.'
- '"But I''m sorry you won''t be able to go through college as you planned.'
- Don't give up hope yet, Slim.
- One never knows what may happen.
- Perhaps the thief who did rob Tower Mansion will be found."
- So they said good-by and wished him good luck.
- '"I sure feel sorry for him," said Frank, as he and Joe started for home.'
- '"He was such a hard worker in school and counted so much on going to college."'
- '"We''ve just got to clear up the Tower robbery, that''s all there is to it!"'
- As they neared the Hardy home, the boys' steps quickened.
- Would they find that their father had returned with the information on the identity
  of the thief?
- Or was he still in New York?
- And were they about to share another of his secrets?
- FRANK and Joe's first stop was the Hardy garage.
- Looking in, they saw that only Mrs. Hardy's car was there.
- Their father had taken his sedan to the airport and not brought it back.
- '"Dad''s not home!"'
- Joe cried excitedly.
- '"Now we''ll hear what the surprise is."'
- Dashing into the kitchen, he called, "Mother!"
- '"I''m upstairs, dear," Mrs. Hardy called back.'
- The boys rushed up the front stairway two steps at a time.
- Their mother met them at the door of their bedroom.
- Smiling broadly, she pointed to a packed suitcase on Frank's bed.
- The boys looked puzzled.
- Next, from her dress pocket, Mrs. Hardy brought out two plane tickets and some dollar
  bills.
- Frank and Joe were speechless for a moment, then they grabbed their mother in a
  bear hug.
- '"This is super!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"What a surprise!"'
- Frank looked affectionately at his mother.
- '"You sure were busy today-getting our plane tickets and money.'
- I wish you were going too."
- Mrs. Hardy laughed.
- '"I''ll go some other time.'
- Well, let's hurry downstairs.
- There's a snack ready for you.
- Then I'll drive my detective sons to the airport."
- In less than two hours the boys were on the plane to New York City.
- Upon landing there, they were met by Mr. Hardy.
- He took them to his hotel, where he had engaged an adjoining room for them.
- It was not until the doors were closed that he brought up the subject of the mystery.
- '"The case has taken an interesting turn, and may involve considerable research.'
- That's why I thought you might help me."
- '"Tell us what has happened so far," Frank requested eagerly.'
- After sending in his card to the manager he had been admitted readily.
- '"That''s because the name of Fenton Hardy is known from the Atlantic to the Pacific!"'
- Joe interjected proudly.
- The detective gave his son a wink and went on with the story. "
- '''Some of our customers in trouble, Mr.'
- '''Not yet,'' I said.'
- '''But one of them may be if I can trace the purchaser of this wig.'''
- '"The manager picked it up.'
- He inspected it carefully and frowned.
- '''We sell mainly to an exclusive theatrical trade.'
- I hope none of the actors has done anything wrong.'
- '" ''Can you tell me who bought this one?'''
- I asked. "
- '''We make wigs only to order,'' the manager said.'
- He pressed a button at the side of his desk.
- A boy came and departed with a written message.
- '''It may be difficult.'
- This wig is not a new one.
- In fact, I would say it was fashioned about two years ago.'
- '" ''A long time.'
- But still-' I encouraged him," the detective went on.
- '''Kauffman, here,'' the manager said, ''is our expert.'
- What he doesn't know about wigs isn't worth knowing.'
- Then, turning to the old man, he handed him the red wig.
- '''Remember it, Kauffman?'''
- '"The old man looked at it doubtfully.'
- Then he gazed at the ceiling.
- '''Red wig-red wig-'' he muttered. "'
- '''About two years old, isn''t it?'''
- '''Not quite.'
- Year'n a half, I'd say.
- Looks like a comedy-character type.
- Wait'11 I think.
- There ain't been so many of our customers playin' that kind of a part inside a year
  and a half.
- Let's see.
- Let's see.'
- The old man paced up and down the office, muttering names under his breath.
- Suddenly he stopped, snapping his fingers. "
- '''I have it,'' he said.'
- '''It must have been Morley who bought that wig.'
- That's who it was!
- Harold Morley.
- He's playin' in Shakespearean repertoire with Hamlin's company.
- Very fussy about his wigs.
- Has to have 'em just so.
- '" ''Why would he do that?'''
- I asked him.
- '"Kauffman shrugged his shoulders.'
- '''Ain''t none of my business.'
- Lots of actors keep a double set of wigs.
- Morley's playin' down at the Crescent Theater right now.
- Call him up.'
- '" ''I''ll go and see him,'' I told the men.'
- And that's just what we'll do, Frank and Joe, after a bite of supper."
- '"You don''t think this actor is the thief, do you?"'
- Frank asked in amazement.
- '"How could he have gone back and forth to Bayport so quickly?'
- And isn't he playing here in town every night?"
- Mr. Hardy admitted that he too was puzzled.
- It was improbable, in any case, that the actor was a thief.
- The three Hardys arrived at Mr. Morley's dressing room half an hour before curtain
  time.
- He was diligently rubbing creamy stage make-up on his face.
- He did not turn around, but eyed his visitors in the mirror, casually telling them
  to sit down.
- Mr. Hardy took the only chair.
- The boys squatted on the floor.
- '"Glad to meet you.'
- What kind of call is this?
- Social -or professional?"
- Morley continued rubbing the make-up on his jowls.
- '"Out with it," he said briefly.'
- '"Ever see this wig before?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked him, laying the hair piece on the make-up table.
- Morley turned from the mirror, and an expression of delight crossed his plump countenance.
- '"Well, I''ll say I''ve seen it before!"'
- '"Old Kauffman-the best wigmaker in the country -made this for me about a year and
  a half ago.'
- Where did you get it?
- I sure didn't think I'd ever see this red wig again."
- '"Stolen from me.'
- Some low-down sneak got in here and cleaned out my dressing room one night during
  the performance.
- Nerviest thing I ever heard of.
- Nobody saw him come or go.
- Must have got in by that window."
- Morley talked in short, rapid sentences, and there was no mistaking his sincerity.
- '"All the wigs were red," he stated.'
- Kauffman made it specially for me.
- I had to get him to make another.
- But say-where did you find it?"
- '"Oh, my sons located it during some detective work we''re on.'
- The crook left this behind.
- I was trying to trace him by it."
- Morley did not inquire further.
- '"That''s all the help I can give you," he said.'
- '"The police never did learn who cleaned out my dressing room," "Too bad.'
- Well, I'll probably get him some other way.
- Give me a list and description of the articles he took from you.
- Probably I can trace him through that."
- '"Glad to," said Morley.'
- He reached into a drawer and drew out a sheet of paper which he handed to the detective.
- '"That''s the same list I gave the police when I reported the robbery.'
- Number of the watch, and everything.
- I didn't bother to mention the wigs.
- Figured they wouldn't be in any condition to wear if I did get them back."
- Mr. Hardy folded the list and put it in his pocket.
- Morley glanced at his watch, lying face up beside the mirror, and gave an exclamation.
- '"Suffering Sebastopol!'
- Curtain in five minutes and I'm not half made up yet.
- Excuse me, folks, but I've got to get on my horse.
- In this business I'll be ready in a minute' doesn't go."
- Mr. Hardy and his sons left.
- They made their way out to the street.
- '"Not much luck there," Frank commented.'
- '"Except through Mr. Morley''s stolen jewelry," his father reminded him.'
- '"If that''s located in a pawnshop, it may lead to the thief.'
- Well, boys, would you like to go into the theater via the front entrance and see
  the show?"
- '"Right," the detective said.'
- The Hardys thanked him and left.
- '"All this trip for nothing."'
- Joe gave a sigh.
- His father laid a hand on the boy's shoulder.
- '"A good detective," he said, "never sighs with discouragement nor becomes impatient.'
- It took years of persistence to solve some famous cases."
- He suggested that their next effort be devoted to doing some research in the city's
  police files.
- Frank and Joe accompanied him to headquarters and the work began.
- First came a run-down on any known New York criminals who used disguises.
- Of these men, the Hardys took the reports on the ones who were thin and of medium
  height.
- Next came a check by telephone on the whereabouts of these people.
- '"I''ll bet he''s our man!"'
- Frank exclaimed.
- '"But where is he now?"'
- THE suspect, the Hardys learned, was out of prison on parole.
- '"He lives right here in New York, and maybe he''s back home by this time," Joe
  spoke up.'
- '"Let''s go see him."'
- '"Just a minute," Mr. Hardy said, holding up his hand.'
- '"I don''t like to leave Mother alone so long.'
- Besides, in this type of sleuthing three detectives together are too noticeable
  to a crook.
- This Jackley may or may not be our man.
- But if he is, he's probably dangerous.
- I want you boys to take the evening plane home.
- I'll phone the house the minute the thief is in custody."
- '"All right, Dad," his sons chorused, though secretly disappointed that they had
  to leave.'
- Hers was the humanitarian side.
- '"I went to call on the Robinsons to try to bolster their spirits," she said.'
- '"I told them about your trip to New York and that seemed to cheer them a lot.'
- Monday I'm going to bake a ham and a cake for you to take to them.
- Mrs. Robinson isn't well and can do little in the kitchen."
- '"That''s swell of you!"'
- Frank said admiringly.
- '"I''ll go."'
- Joe told them he had a tennis match to play.
- '"I''ll do the next errand," he promised.'
- Monday, during a change of classes, Frank met Callie Shaw in the corridor.
- '"Hit" she said.'
- '"What great problem is on Detective Hardy''s mind?'
- You look as if you'd lost your best criminal!"
- Frank grimaced.
- '"Maybe I have," he said.'
- '"But there was no word, Callie, and I''m worried Dad may be in danger."'
- '"I don''t blame you," she said.'
- '"What do you think has happened?"'
- '"Well, you never can tell when you''re dealing with criminals."'
- '"Now, Frank, you''re not trying to tell me your father would let himself get trapped?"'
- Callie said.
- '"No, I don''t think he would, Callie.'
- Maybe Dad hasn't returned because he still hasn't found the man he was looking for."
- '"Well, I certainly hope that thief is caught," said Callie.'
- '"But, Frank, nobody really believes Mr. Robinson did it!"'
- '"Nobody but Hurd Applegate and the men who employ people.'
- Until they find the man who did take the stuff, Mr. Robinson is out of a job."
- '"I''m going over to see the Robinsons soon.'
- Where are they living?"
- Frank gave Callie the address.
- Her eyes widened.
- '"Why, that''s in one of the poorest sections of the city!'
- Frank, I had no idea the Robinsons' plight was that bad!"
- '"It is-and it''ll be a lot worse unless Mr. Robinson gets work pretty soon.'
- Slim's earnings aren't enough to take care of the whole family.
- Say, Callie, how about going over to the Robinsons' with me after school?
- Mother's sending a ham and a cake."
- '"I''d love to," Callie agreed.'
- The two parted at the door of the algebra teacher's classroom.
- As soon as the last bell had rung, Frank and Callie left the building together.
- First they stopped at the Shaw house to leave the girl's books.
- When the couple reached the Hardy home, Frank asked his mother if any messages had
  come.
- '"No, not yet," she answered.'
- But after he and Callie reached the street, he again confided his concern to Callie.
- '"It does seem strange you haven''t heard anything," she admitted.'
- '"But don''t forget the old saying, ''No news is good news,'' so don''t worry."'
- '"I''ll take your advice," Frank agreed.'
- '"No use wearing a sour look around the Robinsons."'
- '"Or when you''re with me, either," Callie said, tossing her head teasingly.'
- Frank hailed an approaching bus bound for the section of the city in which the Robinsons
  lived.
- He and Callie climbed aboard.
- It was a long ride and the streets became less attractive as they neared the outskirts
  of Bayport.
- '"It''s a shame, that''s what it is!"'
- '"The Robinsons were always accustomed to having everything so nice!'
- And now they have to live here!
- Oh, I hope your father catches the man who committed that robbery-and soon!"
- Her eyes flashed and for a moment she looked so fierce that Frank laughed.
- '"I suppose you''d like to be the judge and jury at his trial, eh?"'
- '"I''d give him a hundred years in jail!"'
- Callie declared.
- There were small houses badly in need of paint and repairs.
- Shabbily dressed children were playing in the roadway.
- The picket fence had been repaired and the yard had been cleaned up.
- '"This is where they live," said Frank.'
- Callie smiled.
- '"It''s the neatest place on the whole street."'
- Paula and Tessie answered their knock.
- The twins' faces lighted up with pleasure when they saw who the callers were.
- '"Frank and Callie!"'
- '"Come in."'
- The callers were greeted with kindly dignity by Mrs. Robinson.
- She looked pale and thin but had the same self-possession she had always shown at
  Tower Mansion.
- '"We can''t stay long," Callie explained.'
- '"But Frank and I just thought we''d run out to see how you all are.'
- And we brought something for you."
- The fruit, ham, and cake were presented.
- '"Frank, tell your mother I can''t thank her enough."'
- Frank grinned as Mrs. Robinson went on, "Callie, we shall enjoy this fruit very
  much.
- Many thanks."
- Paula said, "It's a wonderful gift.
- Say, did you know Perry got a better job the second day he was at the supermarket?"
- That's swell," Frank replied.
- '"It didn''t take the manager long to find out how smart Slim is, eh?"'
- The twins giggled, but Mrs. Robinson said dolefully, "I wish my husband could find
  a job.
- Since no one around here will employ him, he is thinking of going to another city
  to get work."
- '"And leave you here?"'
- '"I suppose so.'
- We don't know what to do."
- '"It''s so unfair!"'
- Paula flared up.
- Mrs. Robinson said to Frank hesitantly, "Has Mr. Hardy discovered anything-yet?"
- '"I don''t know," Frank admitted.'
- '"We haven''t heard from him.'
- He's been in New York following up some clues.
- But so far there's been no word."
- '"We hardly dare hope that he''ll be able to clear Mr. Robinson," the woman said
  sorrowfully.'
- '"The whole case is so mysterious."'
- '"I''ve stopped thinking of it," Tessie declared.'
- '"If the mystery is cleared up, okay.'
- If it isn't-we won't starve, at any rate, and my father knows we believe in him."
- '"Yes, I suppose it doesn''t do much good to keep talking about it," agreed Mrs.
  Robinson.'
- '"We''ve gone over the whole matter so thoroughly that there is nothing more to
  say."'
- As they were leaving, Mrs. Robinson drew Frank to one side.
- '"Promise me one thing," she said.'
- '"Let me know as soon as your father returns-that is, if he has any news."'
- '"I''ll do that, Mrs. Robinson," Frank agreed.'
- '"I know what this suspense must be like for you and the twins."'
- '"It''s terrible.'
- Callie and Frank were unusually silent all the way home.
- Callie lived but a few blocks from the Hardy home, and Frank accompanied her to
  the door.
- '"See you tomorrow," he said.'
- '"Yes, Frank.'
- And I hope you'll hear good news from your father."
- The boy quickened his steps and ran eagerly into the Hardy house.
- Joe met him.
- '"Any phone call?"'
- Joe shook his head.
- '"Mother''s pretty worried that something has happened to Dad."'
- ANOTHER whole day went by.
- When still no word had come from Mr. Hardy, his wife phoned the New York hotel.
- She was told that the detective had checked out the day before.
- Then, the following morning when Mrs. Hardy came to awaken them, she wore a broad
  smile.
- '"Your father is home!"'
- '"He''s all right but has had a bad time.'
- He's asleep now and will tell you everything after school."
- '"Dad must be mighty tired," Joe remarked, as Mrs. Hardy went downstairs to start
  breakfast.'
- '"I wonder where he came from."'
- '"Probably he was up all night.'
- When he's working on a case, he forgets about sleep.
- Do you think he found out anything?"
- '"Hope so, Frank.'
- I wish he'd wake up and tell us.
- I hate to go back to school without knowing."
- As soon as classes were over, they shattered all records in their race home.
- Fenton Hardy was in the living room, and as they rushed in panting, he grinned broadly.
- '"Hello, boys!'
- Sorry I worried you and Mother."
- '"What luck, Dad?"'
- '"Good and bad.'
- 'Here''s the story: I went to the house where Red Jackley was boarding.'
- '"How could you do that?"'
- '"By taking a room in the same house and pretending to be a fellow criminal."'
- Joe cried.
- '"And then?"'
- '"Jackley himself spoiled everything.'
- He got mixed up in a jewel robbery and cleared out of the city.
- Luckily, I heard him packing, and I trailed him.
- The police were watching for him and he couldn't get out of town by plane or bus.
- He outwitted the police by jumping a freight on the railroad."
- '"And you still followed?"'
- '"I lost him two or three times, but fortunately I managed to pick up his trail
  again.'
- He got out of the city and into upper New York State.
- Then his luck failed him.
- A railroad detective recognized Jackley and the chase was on.
- Up to that time I had been content with just keeping behind him.
- I had still hoped to pose as a fellow fugitive and win his confidence.
- But when the pursuit started in earnest, I had to join the officers."
- '"And they caught Jackley?"'
- '"Not without great difficulty.'
- Jackley, by the way, was once a railroad man.
- Strangely enough, he worked not many miles from here.
- He managed to steal a railroad handcar and got away from us.
- Frank asked quickly.
- But he's in a hospital right now and the doctors say he hasn't much of a chance."
- '"He''s under arrest?"'
- '"Oh, yes.'
- He's being held for the jewel thefts and also for the theft from the actor's dressing
  room.
- But he probably won't live to answer either charge."
- '"Didn''t you find out anything that would connect him with the Tower robbery?"'
- '"Not a thing."'
- The boys were disappointed, and their expressions showed it.
- If Red Jackley died without confessing, the secret of the Tower robbery would die
  with him.
- Mr. Robinson might never be cleared.
- He might be doomed to spend the rest of his life under a cloud, suspected of being
  a thief.
- '"Have you talked to Jackley?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"I didn''t have a chance-he wasn''t conscious."'
- '"Then you may never be able to get a confession from him."'
- Fenton Hardy shrugged.
- '"I may be able to.'
- If Jackley regains consciousness and knows he's going to die, he may admit everything.
- I intend to see him in the hospital and ask him about the Tower robbery."
- '"Is he far away?"'
- '"You say he used to work near here?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"He was once employed by the railroad, and he knows all the country around here
  well.'
- I suppose he came back here because he is so familiar with this area."
- '"I promised to call Mrs. Robinson," Frank spoke up.'
- '"Okay to tell her about Jackley?"'
- '"Yes, it may cheer her up.'
- But ask her not to tell anyone."
- Frank dialed the number and relayed part of his father's story.
- Just as Frank finished the call, the doorbell rang.
- Frank ushered in the private detective Oscar Smuff.
- '"Your pa home?"'
- Come in."
- Frank led the way into the living room.
- Smuff, although he considered himself a top-notch sleuth, stood in awe of Fenton
  Hardy.
- He cleared his throat nervously.
- '"Good afternoon, Oscar," said Mr. Hardy pleasantly.'
- '"Won''t you sit down?"'
- Detective Smuff eased himself into an armchair, then glanced inquiringly at the
  two boys.
- At once Mr. Hardy said, "Unless your business is very private, I'd like to have
  my sons stay."
- '"Well, I reckon that''ll be all right," Smuff conceded.'
- '"I hear you''re working on this Applegate case."'
- '"Perhaps I am."'
- '"Very clever of you, Detective Smuff," Mr. Hardy said, smiling at his visitor.'
- Smuff squirmed uneasily in his chair.
- I was just wonderin' if you'd found any clues."
- Mr. Hardy's smile faded.
- He said, with annoyance, "If I went away, it is my own business.
- And if I'm working on the Tower robbery, that also is my business.
- You'll have to find your own clues, Oscar."
- '"Well, now, don''t get on your high horse, Mr. Hardy,'' the visitor remonstrated.'
- '"I''m just anxious to get this affair cleared up and I thought we might work together.'
- I heard you were with the officers what chased this here notorious criminal Red
  Jackley."
- Mr. Hardy gave a perceptible start.
- The local police must have received the information and somehow Smuff had heard
  the news.
- '"What of it?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked in a casual way.
- '"Did Jackley have anything to do with the Tower case?"'
- '"How should I know?"'
- '"Wasn''t that what you were workin'' on?"'
- '"As I''ve told you, that''s my affair."'
- Detective Smuff looked sad.
- '"I guess you just don''t want to cooperate with me, Mr. Hardy.'
- Mr. Hardy's lips narrowed into a straight line.
- '"You can''t do that, Oscar.'
- He isn't conscious.
- The doctor won't let you see him."
- '"I''m goin'' to try.'
- Jackley'll come to some time and I want to be on hand.
- There's a plane at six o'clock, and I aim to leave my house about five-thirty and
  catch it."
- He thumped his chest in admiration.
- '"Detectives don''t have to show up for a plane till the last minute, eh, Mr. Hardy?'
- Well, I'll have a talk with Jackley tonight.
- And I may let you know what he says."
- '"Have it your own way," said Mr. Hardy.'
- '"But if you take my advice you''ll not visit the hospital.'
- You'll just spoil everything.
- Jackley will talk when the times comes."
- '"So there is somethin'' in it!"'
- Smuff said triumphantly.
- '"Well, I''m goin'' over there and get a confession!"'
- With that he arose, stumped out of the room, and left the house.
- AFTER Smuff left the house, Mr. Hardy sat back with a gesture of despair.
- At that moment the telephone rang.
- The boys listened excitedly as Mr. Hardy answered.
- Oh, yes, doctor.
- '... Is that so?'
- Jackley will probably live only until morning?
- I can see him.
- Thank you.
- The detective put back the receiver and turned to the boys.
- '"I''ll take that six-o''clock plane to Albany.'
- But if Smuff goes too, it may ruin everything.
- The Albany police and I must question Jackley first."
- '"When''s the next commercial flight after six?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Seven o''clock."'
- '"Then," said Frank, "Smuff can take that one and question Jackley later.'
- Come on, Joe.
- Let's see what we can do to help Dad!"
- '"Don''t you boys do anything rash," their father warned.'
- '"We won''t."'
- Frank led the way outdoors and started walking down the street.
- '"What''s on your mind?"'
- Joe asked as they !
- '"We must figure out how to keep Detective Smuff in Bayport until seven o''clock."'
- '"But how?"'
- '"I don''t know yet, but we''ll find a way.'
- Smuff might ruin things so the case will never be solved."
- '"You''re right."'
- The brothers walked along the street in silence.
- They realized that the situation was urgent.
- '"Let''s round up our gang," Joe suggested finally.'
- '"Perhaps they''ll have some ideas."'
- The Hardys found their friends on the tennis courts of Bayport High.
- '"Hi, fellows!"'
- '"You''re too late for a game.'
- Where've you been?"
- '"We had something important to do," Frank replied.'
- '"Say, we need your help."'
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- '"We can''t tell you much more than that.'
- But the main thing is, we want to keep him from catching the six-o'clock plane.
- We-er- don't want him to go until seven."
- '"What do you want us to do?"'
- Bill Hooper asked.
- '"Help us figure out how to keep Smuff in Bay-port until seven o''clock."'
- '"Without having Chief Collig lock us up?"'
- Jerry Gilroy put in.
- '"Are you serious about this, Frank?"'
- If Smuff gets to a certain place before Dad can, the case will be ruined.
- And I don't mind telling you that it has something to do with Slim Robinson."
- Chet Morton whistled.
- '"Oh, ho!'
- I catch on.
- The Tower business.
- If that's it, we'll make sure the six-o'clock plane leaves here without that nutty
  detective."
- '"So our problem," said Phil solemnly, "is to keep Smuff here and keep out of trouble
  ourselves."'
- '"Well," Jerry Gilroy said, "let''s put our heads together, fellows, and work out
  a plan."'
- A dozen ideas were put forth, each wilder than the one before.
- '"We could rescue him later," he said.'
- The proposal was so ridiculous that the others howled with laughter.
- Phil Cohen suggested setting the detective's watch back an hour.
- '"That''s a keen ideal" Chet cried enthusiastically.'
- '"Let''s do it!"'
- '"Wait a minute, fellows," Frank spoke up.'
- '"If Smuff ever found out who wrote it, we''d be up to our necks in trouble.'
- We could all be arrested!"
- '"I know!"'
- Joe cried suddenly, snapping his fingers.
- '"Why didn''t I think of it before?'
- And it's so simple, too."
- '"Well, tell us!"'
- Frank urged.
- He stayed open evenings until nine.
- '"Rocco''s is only a block from Smuff''s house.'
- Smuff knows Frank and I go there, so he wouldn't be surprised to see us in the neighborhood.
- Maybe we can even get him into the shop.
- You know Smuff loves to eat."
- '"You can''t hate him for that," Chet spoke up.'
- '"I''ll be glad to invite him in and buy him an apple for his trip."'
- '"A fifteen-minute delay for Smuff is all we need," Frank said.'
- '"I think it''s a swell idea," Biff spoke up.'
- '"And I''m sure Mr. Rocco will co-operate."'
- '"Who''s going to persuade him?"'
- Phil asked.
- '"That''s Frank and Joe''s department," Jerry replied.'
- Rocco was a hard-working man who had come from Italy only a few years ago.
- He was a simple, genial person and had great admiration for the Hardy boys.
- The whole group made their way toward the fruit store, but only the Hardys went
  inside.
- The others spread out to watch for Smuff, who was expected to leave his house soon.
- Each boy went over his part in the plan.
- When Frank and Joe walked into the fruit store, they found the dark-eyed Rocco sorting
  oranges.
- '"Buona sera" he said.'
- '"Good evening.'
- How you like my fix the place?"
- '"Looks swell," Frank answered.'
- '"New bins.'
- Better lights."
- Then he added, "How does your neighbor Smuff like it?"
- Rocco threw up his hands in a gesture of disgust.
- '"Oh, that man!'
- He make me mad.
- He say I charge too much.
- He tell me I ought to go back to old country."
- '"Don''t pay any attention to him," Joe advised.'
- '"Say, Mr. Rocco," he went on, "you look tired.'
- Why don't you go home for an hour or so and let Frank and me take over here?"
- '"You think I look tired?'
- That worry my wife.
- Then Rosa say I must close up early."
- Rocco sighed.
- '"You very kind boys.'
- I do what you say.
- Come back six-thirty."
- As Rocco removed his apron, he said, "I fix trash in yard to burn.
- You do that?"
- '"Glad to."'
- Rocco showed them a wire incinerator in the yard, then left the store.
- Five minutes later there was a whistle from the street.
- A signal from Jerry I Frank and Joe went to the front door to watch.
- Smuff was just backing his car out of the driveway.
- As prearranged, Phil hurried over and stopped him.
- The conversation took less than two minutes, then Smuff backed around into the street.
- '"Hey, Frank," said Joe, "I have an idea.'
- Go light that trash.
- Make it a roaring fire!"
- He dashed through the store and into the yard.
- Quickly he lighted the papers in the incinerator in several places.
- The rubbish blazed lustily.
- Joe was intently watching the scene down the street.
- The detective hesitated, then shook his head and started off in his car.
- Only five of the necessary fifteen-minute delay had elapsed I Joe hesitated no longer.
- Running down the street, he held up one hand for the oncoming car to stop.
- '"Come quick, Smuff!"'
- '"Well, you put it out.'
- I'm in a hurry!"
- '"You mean you''d let all of Bayport burn down just because you''re in a hurry?"'
- Joe pretended to scoff.
- Smuff winced, but still did not move.
- Joe said, starting back to the store, "Well, Frank and I will have to take care
  of it alone."
- This brought the detective to action.
- He realized he might be missing a chance to become a hero!
- In a flash he drove his car down the street and parked in front of the fruit store.
- '"Where''s the fire?"'
- Smuff cried out, nearly bumping into Frank who was dashing from the front door of
  Rocco's.
- '"The fire-is-back there-in the yard."'
- Frank pretended to pant.
- '"You go look and see if we ought to turn in an alarm."'
- Smuff dashed inside the store and hurried to the yard.
- By this time the Hardys' friends had gathered in Rocco's fruit store.
- They asked excitedly what was going on.
- '"Where''s Rocco?'
- Where's a pail?
- Where's some water?"
- '"Rocco''s not around," Joe replied to Smuff.'
- '"There''s water in the sink-in the back.'
- Shall I call the fire department?"
- '"No, I can manage this," Smuff declared.'
- '"But where''s a pail?"'
- Frank dashed into the back room and found a pail under the sink.
- He filled it with water and handed the pail to Smuff, who hurried to the yard.
- He doused the incinerator flames which hissed and crackled, then died.
- '"Some people have no sense," Smuff commented.'
- '"The idea of anyone starting a fire, then going off and leaving it!'
- I'll bet that was Rocco's work!
- As for you boys-you had to call me.
- Didn't have the savvy to put out a simple fire."
- '"Good thing you were around," Frank observed, suppressing a smile.'
- '"I''ll say it was," Smuff agreed.'
- '"And Chief Collig is sure goin'' to hear about this."'
- '"I didn''t mean that.'
- Oscar Smuff is no squealer.
- I mean Collig is goin' to hear what I did."
- The detective chuckled.
- '"One more notch in my gun, as the cowboys say."'
- Suddenly Smuff sobered and looked at his wrist watch.
- '"Oh, no!"'
- '"Ten minutes to six!'
- I can't make my plane!"
- '"That''s a shame," Frank said consolingly.'
- '"But cheer up, Smuff, there''s a seven-o''clock plane for Albany.'
- I wish you luck in your interview."
- Smuff stormed out of the fruit store and disappeared with his car.
- All the boys but Frank and Joe left.
- Rocco returned at six-thirty, pleased that so much fruit had been sold during his
  absence.
- '"You better salesman than Rocco."'
- He grinned widely.
- The Hardys went home, well-satisfied with their day's work.
- The six-o'clock plane had left without Smuff.
- Their father could make his trip to the hospital without the annoying detective's
  interference.
- Fenton Hardy did not return home until the next afternoon.
- When the boys came from school they found him in high spirits.
- '"Solved the mystery?"'
- Joe asked eagerly.
- First of all, Jackley is dead."
- '"Did he confess?"'
- '"You''re not very sympathetic toward the poor fellow, Joe.'
- Yes, he confessed.
- Fortunately, Oscar Smuff didn't show up while Jackley was talking."
- Frank and Joe glanced at each other and their father smiled quietly.
- Well, anyhow, the Albany police and I had a clear field.
- I saw Jackley before he died and questioned him about the Tower robbery."
- '"Did he admit everything?"'
- '"Jackley said he came to Bayport with the intention of robbery.'
- He stole a car, smashed it up, and took Chet's.
- Then he went to rob the ticket office.
- When he failed in that he decided to hang around town for a few days.
- He hit upon Tower Mansion as his next effort.
- '"What did he do with the loot?"'
- '"That''s what I''m coming to.'
- It was not until Jackley knew he was at the point of death that he did confess to
  the Tower affair.
- You can get all the stuff back easily.
- It's in the old tower-' "That was all he said.
- Jackley lost consciousness then and never regained it."
- '"When did Smuff get there?"'
- Joe asked eagerly.
- '"Not until after Jackley had gone into a coma," Mr. Hardy replied.'
- '"We both sat by his bed, hoping the man would awaken, but he died within an hour.'
- Just where Jackley hid the loot in the old tower, he was never able to say."
- '"Does Smuff know what Jackley said?"'
- '"If the loot''s hidden in the old Applegate tower, we''ll find it in no time!"'
- Frank exclaimed.
- '"Tower Mansion has two towers-the old and the new," Joe reminded him.'
- '"We''ll search the old tower first."'
- '"The story seems likely enough," Mr. Hardy remarked.'
- '"Jackley would gain nothing by lying about it on his deathbed.'
- Joe nodded.
- '"That was why Jackley couldn''t be traced through the jewels and the bonds.'
- They were never disposed of-they've been lying in the old tower all this time!"
- '"Too bad," said Frank.'
- '"But it shouldn''t be hard to find the loot, now that we have a general idea where
  it is.'
- Probably Jackley didn't hide it very carefully.
- Joe jumped up from his chair.
- '"I think we ought to get busy and go search the old tower right away.'
- Oh, boy!
- Maybe we can hand old Mr. Applegate his jewels and bonds this afternoon and clear
  Mr. Robinson!
- Let's go!"
- '"I''ll leave it to you boys to make the search," said Mr. Hardy with a smile.'
- '"Then you can have the satisfaction of turning over the stolen property to Mr.
  Applegate.'
- I guess you can get along without me in this case from now on."
- '"We wouldn''t have got very far if it hadn''t been for you," Frank declared.'
- '"And I wouldn''t have got very far if it hadn''t been for you, so we''re even."'
- Mr. Hardy's smile broadened.
- '"Well, good luck to you."'
- As the boys started from the study, Frank said, "Thanks, Dad.
- Joe grinned.
- '"Frank, we''ll have that thousand-dollar reward before the day is over!"'
- The tall, stooped gentleman peered at them through his thick-lensed glasses.
- In one hand he held a sheet of stamps.
- '"You remember us, don''t you?"'
- Frank asked politely.
- '"We''re Mr. Hardy''s sons."'
- '"Fenton Hardy, the detective?'
- Oh, yes.
- Well, what do you want?"
- '"We''d like to look through the old tower, if you don''t mind.'
- We have a clue about the robbery."
- '"What kind of clue?"'
- You have evidence, have you?"
- The elderly man peered at the boys closely.
- '"It''s that rascal Robinson, I''ll warrant, who gave it to you.'
- He hid the stuff, and now he's suggesting where you might find it, just to clear
  himself."
- At last Joe spoke up.
- '"Mr. Robinson has nothing to do with this," he said.'
- '"The real thief was found.'
- He said the loot was hidden in the old tower.
- If you will just let us take a look around, we'll find it for you."
- '"Who was the real thief?"'
- Mr. Applegate took off his glasses and wiped them with his handkerchief.
- He stared at the boys suspiciously for a few moments.
- 'Then he called out: "Adelia!"'
- From the dim interior of the hallway a high feminine voice answered.
- '"What do you want?"'
- '"Come here a minute."'
- There was a rustle of skirts, and Adelia Applegate appeared.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- '"I can''t sit down to do a bit of sewing without you interrupting me, Hurd."'
- '"These boys want to look through the old tower."'
- '"What for?'
- Up to some mischief?"
- Frank and Joe feared she would not give her consent.
- Frank said quietly, "We're doing some work for our dad, the detective Fenton Hardy."
- '"They think they can find the bonds and jewels in the tower," Hurd Applegate explained.'
- '"Oh, they do, do they?"'
- '"And what would the bonds and jewels be doing in the old tower?"'
- '"We have evidence that they were hidden there after the robbery," Frank told her.'
- Miss Applegate viewed the boys with obvious suspicion.
- '"As if any thief would be silly enough to hide them right in the house he robbed!"'
- '"We''re just trying to help you," Joe put in courteously.'
- '"Go ahead, then," said Miss Applegate with a sigh.'
- '"But even if you tear the old tower to pieces, you won''t find anything.'
- It's all foolishness."
- He said he was inclined to share his sister's opinion that the boys' search would
  be in vain.
- '"We''ll make a try at it, anyway, Mr. Applegate," Frank said.'
- '"Don''t ask me to help you.'
- I've got a bad knee.
- Anyway, I just received some new stamps this afternoon.
- You interrupted me when I was sorting them.
- I must get back to my work."
- The man reached a corridor that was heavily covered with dust.
- It apparently had not been in use for a long time and was bare and unfurnished.
- At the end was a heavy door.
- It was unlocked, and when Mr. Applegate opened it, the boys saw a square room.
- Almost in the center of it rose a flight of wooden stairs with a heavily ornamented
  balustrade.
- The stairway twisted and turned to the roof, five floors above.
- Opening from each floor was a room.
- '"There you are," Mr. Applegate announced.'
- '"Search all you want to.'
- But you won't find anything-of that I'm certain."
- The Hardy boys looked at each other.
- '"Not very encouraging, is he?"'
- Joe remarked.
- '"He doesn''t deserve to get his stuff back," Frank declared flatly, then shrugged.'
- '"Let''s get up into the tower and start the search."'
- Frank and Joe first examined the dusty stairs carefully for footprints, but none
  were to be seen.
- '"That seems queer," Frank remarked.'
- '"If Jackley was here recently you''d think his footprints would still show.'
- Judging by this dust, there hasn't been anyone in the tower for at least a year."
- '"Perhaps the dust collects more quickly than we think," Joe countered.'
- '"Or the wind may get in here and blow it around."'
- But they found nothing there.
- The boys ascended to the next floor, and entered the room to the left of the stair
  well.
- It was as drab and bare as the one they had just left.
- Here again the dust lay thick and the murky windows were almost obscured with cobwebs.
- '"Nothing here," said Frank after a quick glance around.'
- '"On we go."'
- They made their way up to the next floor.
- After searching this room and under the stairway, they had to admit defeat.
- The floor above was a duplicate of the first and second.
- It was bare and cheerless, deep in dust.
- '"Doesn''t look very promising, Joe.'
- Still, Jackley may have gone right to the top of the tower."
- The search continued without success until the boys reached the roof.
- Here a trap door which swung inward led to the top of the tower.
- Frank unlatched it and pulled on the door.
- It did not budge.
- '"I''ll help you," Joe offered.'
- Together the brothers yanked on the stubborn trap door of the old tower.
- Suddenly it gave way completely, causing both boys to lose their balance.
- Frank fell backward down the stairway.
- Joe, with a cry, toppled over the railing into space!
- Frank grabbed a spindle of the balustrade and kept himself from sliding farther
  down the steps.
- '"Oh, Joe!"'
- To Frank's amazement, he heard no thud and now looked over the balustrade.
- His brother was not lying unconscious at the bottom of the tower.
- Instead, he was clinging to two spindles of the stairway on the floor below.
- Both boys sat down to catch their breaths and recover from their falls.
- Finally Joe said, "Thanks.
- For a second I sure thought I was going to end my career as a detective right here!"
- '"You must have grabbed those spindles with flash-camera speed."'
- Presently the boys turned their eyes upward.
- An expression halfway between a grin and a worried frown crossed their faces.
- '"Mr. Applegate," Joe remarked, "isn''t going to like hearing we ruined his trap
  door."'
- Let's see if we can put it back in place."
- The boys climbed the stairway and examined the damage.
- They found that the hinges had pulled away from rotted wood.
- A new piece would have to be put in to hold the door in place.
- '"Before we go downstairs," said Joe, "let''s look out on the roof.'
- We thought maybe the loot was hidden there.
- There was nothing on it.
- '"Our only reward for all this work is a good view of Bayport," Frank remarked ruefully.'
- '"Dad was fooled by Jackley, I guess," Frank said slowly.'
- '"There hasn''t been anyone in this tower for years."'
- The boys gazed moodily over the city, then down at the grounds of Tower Mansion.
- '"Do you think Jackley might have meant the new tower?"'
- Joe exclaimed suddenly.
- '"Dad said he specified the old one."'
- '"But he may have been mistaken.'
- Even the new one looks old.
- Let's ask Mr. Applegate if we may search the new tower, too."
- '"It''s worth trying, anyway.'
- But I'm afraid when we tell him about the trap door, he'll say no."
- The brothers went down through the opening.
- The door held, but Frank and Joe knew that wind or rain would easily dislodge it.
- The boys hurried down the steps and through the corridor to the main part of the
  house.
- Adelia Applegate popped her head out of a doorway.
- '"Where''s the loot?"'
- '"We didn''t find any," Frank admitted.'
- The woman sniffed.
- '"I told you so!'
- Such a waste of time!"
- '"We think now," Joe spoke up, "that the stolen property is probably hidden in the
  new tower."'
- '"In the new tower!"'
- Miss Applegate cried out.
- I suppose you'll want to go poking through there now."
- '"If it wouldn''t be too much trouble."'
- '"It would be too much trouble, indeed!"'
- '"I shan''t have boys rummaging through my house on a wild-goose chase like this.'
- You'd better leave at once, and forget all this nonsense."
- Her voice had attracted the attention of Hurd Applegate, who came hobbling out of
  his study.
- '"Now what''s the matter?"'
- His sister told him and suddenly his face creased in a triumphant smile.
- So you didn't find anything after all!
- You thought you'd clear Robinson, but you haven't done it."
- '"Not yet," Frank answered.'
- Hurd Applegate stared at the boys.
- '"Well, they can''t do it!"'
- '"Are you boys trying to make a fool of me?"'
- Frank and Joe exchanged glances and nodded at each other.
- They would have to reveal their reason for thinking the loot was in the new tower.
- And it wasn't Mr.
- You mean it was someone else?
- Has he been caught?"
- '"He was captured but he''s dead now."'
- What happened?"
- Hurd Applegate asked in excitement.
- '"His name was Red Jackley and he was a notorious criminal.'
- Dad got on his trail and Jackley tried to escape on a railroad handcar.
- It smashed up and he was fatally injured," Frank explained.
- '"Where did you get your information then?"'
- Mr. Applegate asked.
- Hurd Applegate rubbed his chin meditatively.
- It was evident that he was impressed by the boys' story.
- '"So this fellow Jackley confessed to the robbery, eh?"'
- '"He admitted everything.'
- He had once worked around here and knew the Bayport area well.
- He had been hanging around the city for several days before the robbery."
- '"Will you let us search it?"'
- Joe asked eagerly.
- '"Yes, and I''ll help.'
- I'm just as eager to find the jewels and bonds as you are.
- Come on, boys!"
- Hurd Applegate led the way across the mansion toward a door which opened into the
  new tower.
- He did so, offering to pay for the repair.
- '"Oh, that''s all right," said Mr. Applegate.'
- '"I''ll have it fixed.'
- In fact, Robinson- Oh, I forgot.
- I'll get a carpenter."
- He said no more, but quickened his steps.
- Frank and Joe grinned.
- Old Mr. Applegate had not even reprimanded them!
- The mansion owner opened the door to the new tower and stepped into a corridor.
- Frank and Joe, tingling with excitement, followed.
- THE rooms in the new tower had been furnished when it was built.
- They even turned up mattresses and rugs.
- Again their investigation proved fruitless.
- Hurd Applegate, being a quick-tempered man, fell back into his old mood.
- '"It''s a hoax!"'
- '"Adelia was right.'
- I've been made a fool of!
- And all because of Robinson!"
- '"I can''t understand it!"'
- Joe burst out.
- '"Jackley said he hid the stuff in the tower."'
- Or else Robinson found the loot right after the robbery and kept it for himself."
- '"I''m sure Mr. Robinson wouldn''t do that," Joe objected.'
- '"Then where did he get the nine hundred dollars?'
- Explain that.
- Robinson won't!"
- On the way back to the main part of the mansion, Hurd Applegate elaborated on his
  theory.
- '"Like as not he was in league with Jackley!"'
- Again Frank and Joe protested that the ex-caretaker did not hobnob with criminals.
- Nevertheless, the Hardys were puzzled, disappointed, and alarmed.
- Their search had only resulted in implicating Mr. Robinson more deeply in the mystery.
- '"Didn''t I tell you?"'
- '"Hurd Applegate, you''ve let these boys make a fool of you!"'
- '"We sure messed things up, Frank," Joe declared, as they walked toward their motorcycles.'
- '"I feel like a dud rocket."'
- '"Me too."'
- They hurried home to tell their father the disappointing news.
- Fenton Hardy was amazed to hear that the stolen valuables had not been located in
  either tower.
- '"You''re sure you went over the place thoroughly?"'
- '"Every inch of it.'
- There wasn't a sign of the loot.
- From the dust in the old tower, I'd say no one had been there for ages," Frank replied.
- '"Strange," the detective muttered.'
- '"I''m sure Jackley wasn''t lying.'
- He had absolutely nothing to gain by deceiving me.
- '''I hid it in the old tower.'''
- Those were his very words.
- And what could he mean but the old tower of Tower Mansion?
- And why should he be so careful to say the old tower?
- '"Of course, it may be that we didn''t search thoroughly enough," Joe remarked.'
- '"The loot could be hidden under the flooring or behind a movable wall panel.'
- We didn't look there."
- '"That''s the only solution," Mr. Hardy agreed.'
- '"I''m still not satisfied that the stolen property isn''t there.'
- I'm going to ask Applegate to permit another search of both towers.
- And now, I think your mother wants you to do an errand downtown."
- Mrs. Hardy explained what she wanted and Frank and Joe were soon on their motorcycles
  again.
- When he saw the Hardy boys he glowered.
- '"Well," he grunted, "I hear you got the stuff back."'
- '"I wish we had," Frank said glumly.'
- '"You didn''t get it?'
- I thought they said on the radio that this fellow Jackley had told your father where
  he hid it."
- '"He did.'
- But how did the news leak out?"
- '"Jackley''s door wasn''t closed all the time.'
- One of the other patients who was walking by the room heard the confession and spilled
  it.
- So you didn't find the loot after all!
- That's a good one!
- Didn't Jackley say the stuff was hidden in the old tower?
- What more do you need?"
- '"Well, it wasn''t there!"'
- Joe retorted hotly.
- '"Jackley must have made a mistake!"'
- '"Jackley made a mistake!"'
- Smuff continued cheerfully.
- '"It looks like the joke''s on you fellows and your father!"'
- The would-be sleuth went on down the street, chuckling to himself.
- '"Boys," he said, "we''ll go there directly after supper.'
- I think we'd better not wait until tomorrow."
- At seven o'clock the detective and his sons presented themselves at the Tower Mansion.
- Hurd Applegate met them at the door.
- I've talked the case over with Chief Collig.
- He's inclined to think that Robinson is behind it all and I'm sure he is."
- '"But how about Jackley''s confession?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked him.
- '"The chief says that could be a blind.'
- Jackley did it to protect Robinson.
- They were working together."
- I heard Jackley make the confession and I don't believe he was lying."
- But I'm telling you it was a hoax."
- Eagerly the four set to work.
- They started at the top of the old tower and worked downward.
- Their investigation left no possibility untouched.
- All the walls were tapped for hollow sounds which might indicate secret hiding places.
- The floors were examined closely for signs of any recent disturbance to the wood.
- But the missing jewels and bonds were not located.
- Finally the group reached the ground floor again.
- '"Nothing to do but go on to the new tower," Mr. Hardy commented briefly.'
- '"I''ll have to rest and eat something before I do any more," Hurd Applegate said
  wearily.'
- He led the way to the dining room where sandwiches and milk had been set out.
- '"Help yourselves," he invited.'
- He himself took only crackers and milk when they all sat down.
- Again they searched carefully.
- Walls and partitions were tapped and floors were sounded.
- Every bit of furniture was minutely examined.
- Not an inch of space escaped the scrutiny of the detective and his helpers.
- And furthermore, there's no evidence that if he did hide it here, anyone came in
  to take it away."
- '"You mean," said Frank, "it''s proof that Mr. Robinson did not come in here?"'
- '"Maybe not," Mr. Applegate conceded.'
- '"But it still doesn''t prove he wasn''t in cahoots with the thief!"'
- '"I''m not going to give up this search yet," Mr. Hardy said determinedly.'
- '"Perhaps the loot was hidden somewhere outside the old tower."'
- He explained that it would be difficult to examine the grounds properly at night.
- As the owner reluctantly nodded his assent, Mr. Hardy turned to Frank and Joe and
  smiled.
- '"We ought to be able to prove our point before schooltime."'
- The detective smiled, and as soon as they reached home he wrote one out, then said
  good night.
- '"Time to get up if you want to be in on the search," he announced.'
- The boys blinked sleepily, then sprang out of bed.
- Showers awakened them fully and they dressed quickly.
- Mrs. Hardy was in the kitchen when they entered it and breakfast was ready.
- The sun was just rising over a distant hill.
- '"Everything hot this morning," Mrs. Hardy said.'
- '"It''s chilly outside."'
- The menu included hot applesauce, oatmeal, poached eggs on toast, and cocoa.
- '"I see you put spades in the car, Dad," Frank remarked.'
- '"I take it we''re going to do some digging."'
- '"Yes, if we don''t locate the loot hidden above ground some place."'
- Everything in the vicinity of both towers was scrutinized.
- Not a clue turned up.
- '"I guess we dig," Frank stated finally.'
- The tool hit an obstruction.
- Excitedly Frank shoveled away the dirt around the spot.
- In half a minute he gave a cry of delight.
- '"A chest!'
- I've found a buried chest!"
- THROWING out the dirt in great spadefuls, Frank uncovered the chest completely.
- It was about two feet long, six inches wide, and a foot deep.
- '"The treasure!"'
- Joe cried out, running up.
- Mr. Hardy was at his son's heels and looked in amazement at Frank's discovery.
- Everyone held his breath.
- Had the Hardys really uncovered the jewels and securities stolen from the Applegates?
- Frank flung back the lid.
- The three sleuths stared at the contents.
- They had never been more surprised in their lives.
- Finally Joe found his voice.
- '"Nothing but a lot of flower bulbs!"'
- The first shock of disappointment over, the detective and his sons burst into laughter.
- '"Well, one thing is sure," said Frank.'
- '"Red Jack-ley never buried this chest.'
- I wonder who did?"
- For a couple of moments we thought we had found your stolen property."
- Hurd Applegate's face took on a stern look.
- '"You didn''t find my securities," he said, "but maybe you have found a clue to
  the thief.'
- Robinson buried that chest full of bulbs.
- That's what he's done with Adelia's jewelry and my securities!
- He's buried them some place, but I'd be willing to bet anything it wasn't on the
  grounds here."
- '"Mr. Applegate," he said, "why did Mr. Robinson bury these flower bulbs here?"'
- The owner of Tower Mansion gave a little snort.
- '"That man''s nutty about unusual flowers.'
- He sent to Europe for these bulbs.
- They have to be kept in a cool, dark place for several months, so he decided to
  bury them.
- He's always doing something queer like that.
- Why, do you know what he tried to get me to do?
- Put up a greenhouse here on the property so he could raise all kinds of rare flowers."
- '"That sounds like a swell hobby," Joe spoke up.'
- '"Swell nothing!"'
- Mr. Applegate replied.
- '"I guess you don''t know how much greenhouses cost.'
- And besides, growing rare flowers takes a lot of time.
- Frank whistled.
- '"If Mr. Robinson can do that, he''s a genius!"'
- '"Genius-that''s a joke!"'
- '"Well, go on with your digging.'
- I want this mystery cleared up."
- Wherever it looked as if the ground had been turned over recently, the boys would
  dig at the spot.
- The chest of flower bulbs was carefully replaced and the dirt shoveled over it.
- But we don't want to miss anything."
- This time Joe's spade hit the object which had been buried.
- As his father had prophesied, it proved to be only a bone secreted by some dog.
- The three Hardys transferred their work to the new tower.
- All this time Hurd Applegate had been looking on in silence.
- Mr. Hardy glanced at his wrist watch, then said, "Well, boys, I guess this is our
  last try."
- He indicated another spot a few feet away.
- '"You fellows must get cleaned up and go to school."'
- Undaunted by their failures so far, Frank and Joe dug in with a will.
- In a few moments they had uncovered another small chest.
- '"Wow, this one is heavy!"'
- Frank said as he lifted it from the hole.
- '"Then maybe-maybe it''s the stolen property!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- Even Mr. Applegate showed keen interest this time and leaned over to raise the lid
  himself.
- The box contained several sacks.
- '"The jewels!"'
- Joe cried out.
- '"And that flat-shaped sack could contain the securities!"'
- Frank said enthusiastically.
- Mr. Applegate picked up one of the circular bags and quickly untied the string wound
  about the top.
- His face took on a look of utter disgust.
- Mr. Hardy had already picked up the flat sack.
- He looked almost as disappointed as Mr. Apple-gate.
- '"Flower catalogs!"'
- '"They seem to be in various foreign languages."'
- '"I told him to destroy them.'
- He paid too much attention to that stuff when he might have been doing something
  useful.
- I suppose he buried the catalogs, so I wouldn't find them."
- After a long breath the elderly man went on, "Well, we've reached the end of the
  line.
- You Hardys haven't proved a thing, but you've certainly torn up my house and grounds."
- They accepted the invitation and enjoyed the meal of waffles and honey.
- Their father then drove them to Bayport High.
- Frank and Joe had no sooner stepped from the car than they heard their names called.
- Turning, they saw Iola Morton and Callie Shaw coming toward them.
- '"Hi, boys!"'
- '"Hi, girls!"'
- '"Say, did you hear what happened early this morning?"'
- Callie asked.
- School called off for today?"
- Joe asked eagerly.
- '"I wish it were."'
- Callie sobered.
- '"It''s about Mr. Robinson.'
- He's been arrested again!"
- The Hardys stared at Callie, thunderstruck.
- Frank demanded.
- Iola took up the story, saying that she and Chet had heard the bad news on the radio
  that morning.
- So he arrested him.
- Poor Mrs. Robinson!
- She doesn't know what to do."
- '"And Mr. Robinson had just managed to find another job," Callie said sadly.'
- '"Oh, can''t you boys do something?"'
- At that moment the school bell rang and the young people had to separate.
- Frank and Joe were deeply concerned by what they had just heard.
- At lunch they met Jerry, Phil, Tony, and Chet Morton and told them the news.
- '"This is tough on Slim," Phil remarked.'
- '"Tough on the whole family," Chet declared.'
- '"That means there''s only one thing to do," Frank said.'
- '"We must find that loot!"'
- After school he and Joe played baseball for the required period, then went directly
  home.
- They had no heart for further sports activities.
- It was a dull, gloomy day, indicative of rain and this did not raise the boys' spirits.
- Frank, who was restless, finally suggested, "Let's take a walk."
- '"Maybe it''ll help clear the cobwebs from our brains," Joe agreed.'
- They told their mother they would be home by suppertime, then set off.
- '"This place is beginning to haunt me," said Joe, as they walked up the driveway.'
- Suddenly Frank caught his brother's arm.
- '"I just had an idea.'
- Maybe Jackley in his deathbed confession was confused and meant some other robbery
  he committed.
- Besides, at some time in every mystery the most innocent-seeming people become suspect.
- What proof is there that the Applegates haven't pulled a hoax?
- For reasons of their own they might say that the things had been stolen from their
  safe.
- Don't forget that Dad didn't find any fingerprints on it except Mr.
- '"Frank, you''ve got a point there.'
- '"Exactly," his brother agreed.'
- '"For the moment, let''s play it this way.'
- We'll pretend they're suspects and do a little spying about this place."
- Instantly the boys left the roadway and disappeared among the shrubbery that lined
  it.
- Making their way cautiously, they moved forward toward Tower Mansion.
- The place was in darkness with the exception of three lighted rooms on the first
  floor.
- '"What''s your idea, Frank?"'
- Maybe we'll get a clue if we keep our eyes and ears open."
- The boys walked forward in silence.
- They approached the mansion from the end where the old tower stood.
- Somewhere, not far from them, they suddenly heard footsteps on the gravel walk.
- In a flash the brothers dodged behind a tree.
- The footsteps came closer and the boys waited to see who was approaching.
- Was it one of the Applegates, or someone else?
- Suddenly a glaring light was beamed directly on them.
- It came from the top room of the old tower!
- Frank ordered in a hoarse whisper, quickly dropping to the ground.
- Instantly Joe threw himself face down alongside his brother.
- '"You think the person with the flashlight in the tower saw us?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"He could have, but maybe not.'
- We sure went down fast."
- The strong flashlight was not trained on them again.
- It was beamed out a window of the tower in another direction, then turned off.
- '"Well, what say?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Shall we go on up to the mansion and continue our sleuthing?"'
- Frank was of the opinion that if they did, they might get into trouble.
- Even if they had not been recognized, the person in the tower probably had spotted
  them.
- '"I''d like to find out who was in the tower," Joe argued.'
- '"It''s just possible that the Applegates don''t know anything about him."'
- Frank laughed quietly.
- '"Don''t let your imagination run away with you," he advised.'
- From around the corner of the tower rushed a huge police dog, growling and barking.
- It apparently had scented the brothers and was bounding directly toward them.
- Frank and Joe started to run pell-mell, but were unable to keep ahead of the dog.
- In a few moments he blocked their path menacingly and set up a ferocious barking.
- '"I guess we''re caught," Frank said.'
- '"And I hope this old fellow won''t take a piece out of my leg."'
- The two boys tried to make friends with the animal, but he would not let them budge.
- '"Well, what do we do now?"'
- Joe asked in disgust as the dog continued to growl menacingly.
- '"Wait to be rescued," Frank replied tersely.'
- He looked ,at the boys in complete astonishment.
- '"You fellows never give up, do you?"'
- '"What have you been doing-more digging?"'
- The brothers did not reply at once.
- The owner of Tower Mansion took their lack of response to mean he was right.
- '"I''m just not going to have any more of my grounds ruined," he said gruffly.'
- '"I''ve borrowed this watchdog, Rex, and he''s going to keep everybody away.'
- If you have any reason for wanting to see me, you'd better phone first, and I'll
  keep Rex chained."
- '"Who was up in the tower with a flashlight?"'
- Frank asked the elderly man.
- '"My sister.'
- Frank and Joe suppressed grins as he went on.
- Apparently she picked you up."
- The boys laughed.
- '"Yes, she did," Frank admitted.'
- '"Between her and Rex, I guess you needn''t worry about any prowlers."'
- Frank and Joe said good night to Hurd Applegate and started down the driveway.
- This time the dog did not follow them.
- He remained at the man's side until the Hardys were out of sight.
- Nothing to show for all our work."
- At supper both Mr. and Mrs. Hardy laughed at the boys' story of their encounter
  with the dog.
- '"It''s possible, of course," the detective answered.'
- '"But the Applegates are so well-to-do I can''t see any point in their trying such
  a thing.'
- I vote we set ourselves the goal of solving the mystery before night."
- '"A big order, but I''m with you," Joe replied with a grin.'
- They were up early and began to discuss what course of sleuthing they should follow.
- '"I think we ought to start off on a completely new tack," Joe suggested.'
- '"In which direction?"'
- Frank asked him.
- '"In the direction of the railroad."'
- '"Good idea, Joe," his brother agreed.'
- '"Let''s take our lunch and make an all-day trip on our motorcycles."'
- Mr. Hardy had left the house very early, so his sons did not see him.
- By the time they were ready to leave she had two small boxes packed with a hearty
  picnic lunch.
- '"Good-by and good luck!"'
- Mrs. Hardy called as the brothers rode off.
- '"Thanks, Mother, for everything!"'
- '"Did he work on a passenger train?"'
- '"I don''t think so," Frank replied.'
- '"I believe he was employed as a maintenance man."'
- He chuckled.
- The boys knew of two grade crossings some miles out of town and now headed for them.
- Frank and Joe went on.
- At the next crossing they found old Mike Hal-ley, the flagman there, busy at his
  job.
- '"You know us?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"I must confess I don''t recall having met you before."'
- '"And you ain''t," the man responded.'
- '"But I make it a rule to memorize every face I see in the newspapers.'
- Never know when there's goin' to be an accident and I might be called on to identify
  some people."
- '"I recollect a man named Jackley, but he wasn''t never called Red when I knew him.'
- I reckon he's the same fellow, though.
- You mean the one that I read went to jail?"
- '"That''s the man!"'
- '"He out of the pen yet?"'
- Mike Halley questioned.
- '"He died," Joe replied.'
- '"Then what you want to do," said the flagman, "is go down to the Bayport and Coast
  Line Railroad.'
- That's where Jackley used to work.
- He was around the station at Cherryville.
- That ain't so far from here."
- He pointed in a northerly direction.
- '"Thanks a million," said Frank.'
- '"You''ve helped us a lot."'
- The brothers set off on their motorcycles for Cherryville.
- The building itself was small, square, and very much in need of paint.
- A few nearby frame buildings were in a bad state of disrepair.
- At the same distance on the other side rose another water tank.
- This one, painted red, was of metal and in much better condition.
- Frank and Joe parked their motorcycles and went into the station.
- A man in his shirt sleeves and wearing a green visor was bustling about behind the
  ticket window.
- '"Are you the stationmaster?"'
- Frank called to him.
- The man came forward.
- You name it.
- I'm your man."
- But first, what do you mean you're a rice thrower?"
- The station agent guffawed.
- I reckon if that'll make 'em happy, I want to be part of the proceedin's."
- Again the Hardys roared with laughter.
- Then Frank inquired if the man had known Red Jackley.
- '"I sure did," Jake replied.'
- '"Funny kind of fellow.'
- Work like mad one minute, then loaf on the job the next.
- One thing about him, he never wanted nobody to give him any orders."
- '"Did you know that he died recently?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"No, I didn''t," the stationmaster answered.'
- '"I''m real sorry to hear that.'
- Jackley wasn't a bad sort when I knew him.
- Just got to keepin' the wrong kind of company, I guess."
- '"Can you tell us any particular characteristics he had?"'
- Frank questioned.
- Jake scratched his head above his visor.
- Finally he said, "The thing I remember most about Jackley is that he was a regular
  monkey.
- He was nimble as could be, racin' up and down freight-car ladders."
- At that moment they heard a train whistle and the man said hurriedly, "Got to leave
  you now, boys.
- Come back some other time when I ain't so busy.
- Got to meet this train."
- The Hardys left him and Frank suggested, "Let's eat our lunch and then come back."
- '"I''m starved," said Frank, seating himself under the tree and opening his box
  of lunch.'
- '"Boy, this is good!"'
- Joe exclaimed a moment later as he bit hungrily into a thick roast beef sandwich.
- '"He sure caused a lot of trouble before he died," Joe agreed.'
- '"And he''s caused a lot more since, the way things have gone.'
- For the Robinsons, especially."
- The boys gazed reflectively down the tracks, gleaming in the sun.
- The rails stretched far into the distance.
- Frank took a bite of his sandwich and chewed it thoughtfully.
- He was wondering whether or not he should mention it to his brother.
- Then he noticed that Joe, too, was gazing intently down the tracks at the tanks.
- Joe raised a cooky to his lips absently, attempted a bite, and missed the cooky
  altogether.
- Still he continued gazing fixedly in the same direction.
- Finally Joe turned and looked at his brother.
- Both knew that they were thinking the identical thing.
- '"Two water towers," Frank said in a low but excited tone.'
- '"An old one and a newer one," Joe murmured.'
- '"And Jackley said-" "He hid the stuff in the old tower."'
- '"He was a railroad man."'
- '"Why not?"'
- Joe shouted, springing to his feet "Why couldn't it have been this old water tower
  he meant?
- He used to work around here."
- '"After all, he didn''t say the old tower of Tower Mansion.'
- He just said 'old tower'!"
- '"Frank, I believe we''ve stumbled on a terrific due!"'
- Joe said jubilantly.
- '"It would be the natural thing for Jackley to come to his former haunts after the
  robbery!"'
- Frank agreed.
- The old water tower!
- This must be the place!"
- LUNCH, motorcycles-everything else was forgotten!
- Someone on the highway above was sounding a car horn.
- Looking up, they recognized the driver.
- '"Oh, good night!"'
- Joe cried out.
- '"The last person we want to see right now," Frank said in disgust.'
- '"We''ll get rid of him in a hurry," Joe determined.'
- The boys turned around and climbed back up the embankment.
- By this time Oscar Smuff had stepped from his car and was walking down to meet the
  boys.
- '"Well, I found you," he said.'
- '"You mean you''ve been looking for us?"'
- Frank asked in astonishment.
- The detective grinned.
- With an ingratiating air he explained to the boys that he had trailed them for miles.
- '"He told me I''d find you here," Smuff said, self-satisfaction evident in his tone.'
- '"But why do you want us?"'
- Joe demanded.
- '"I''ve come to make a proposition," Smuff announced.'
- How about it, fellows?
- If old Smuff lets you in on his secret, will you help him?"
- Frank and Joe were astounded at this turn of events.
- Did the man really know something important?
- Or was he suddenly becoming clever and trying to trick the Hardys into divulging
  what they knew?
- '"Thanks for the compliment," Frank said.'
- He grinned.
- '"Joe and I think we''re pretty good ourselves.'
- We're glad you do."
- '"Then you''ll work with me?"'
- Smuff asked, his eyes lighting up in anticipation.
- '"I didn''t say yes and I didn''t say no," Frank countered.'
- He glanced at Joe, who was standing in back of the detective.
- Joe shook his head vigorously.
- '"Tell you what, Smuff," Frank went on.'
- '"When Joe and I get back to Bayport, we''ll look you up.'
- We came out here to have a picnic lunch and relax."
- Smuff's face fell.
- But he was not giving up so easily.
- '"When I drove up, I saw you running like mad down the bank.'
- Do you call that relaxing?"
- '"Oh, when you sit around awhile eating, your legs feel kind of cramped," Joe told
  him.'
- '"Anyway, we have to keep in practice for the Bayport High baseball team."'
- Smuff looked as if he did not know whether or not he was being kidded.
- But finally he said, "Okay, fellows.
- If you'll get in touch with me the first of the week, I can promise you a big surprise.
- I've already admitted I need help to solve this mystery."
- He turned and slowly ambled up the embankment to his car.
- '"If only we have stumbled on the secret!"'
- Frank said enthusiastically.
- The old water tower reared forlornly alongside the tracks.
- At close quarters it seemed even more decrepit than from a distance.
- '"If Jackley climbed this ladder we can too," said Frank as he stopped, panting,
  at the bottom.'
- '"Let''s go!"'
- He began to scramble up the rotted wood rungs.
- He had ascended only four of them when there came an alarming crack!
- Joe cried out from below.
- Frank clung to the rung above just as the one beneath him snapped under his weight.
- He drew himself up and cautiously put his foot on the next rung.
- This one was firmer and held his weight.
- Joe called up.
- '"Don''t break all the rungs!'
- I want to come up too!"
- Frank continued to climb the ladder as his brother began the ascent.
- But finally Frank reached the top and waited until Joe was just beneath him.
- '"There''s a trap door up here leading down into the tank," Frank called.'
- '"Well, for Pete''s sake, be careful," Joe warned.'
- '"We don''t want any more accidents with trap doors."'
- The boys climbed onto the roof of the tower, which swayed under their weight.
- Both fully realized their peril.
- '"We can''t give up now!"'
- Joe followed.
- They unlatched and raised the door, then peered down into the recesses of the abandoned
  water tank.
- It was about seven feet in depth and twelve in diameter.
- '"It''s okay," he told Joe, who followed his brother inside.'
- Eagerly the boys peered about the dim interior.
- The place seemed to be partly filled with rubbish.
- At first glance there was no sign of the Applegates' stolen possessions.
- '"The jewels and bonds must be here somewhere," Joe declared.'
- '"But if Jackley did put the stuff here, he wouldn''t have left it right out in
  the open.'
- It's probably hidden under some of this junk."
- Frank pulled out a flashlight and swung it around.
- In its glow Joe began to hunt frantically, casting aside the old pails and pieces
  of lumber.
- One entire half of the tower was searched without result.
- '"Joe," said Frank, "I''d say these boards hadn''t been thrown here accidentally.'
- It sure looks as if somebody had placed them deliberately to hide something underneath."
- '"You''re right."'
- Like a terrier after a bone, Joe dived toward the pile.
- Hastily he pulled away the boards.
- Revealed in the neat little hiding place lay a bag.
- '"This must be it!"'
- '"The Tower treasure!"'
- Frank smothered a whoop of joy.
- Joe carried the sack into the light beneath the trap door.
- '"Hurry up!'
- Open it!"
- Frank urged.
- With trembling fingers Joe began to untie the cord around the sack.
- There were many knots, and as Joe worked at them, Frank fidgeted nervously.
- '"Let me try," he said impatiently.'
- Joe plunged one hand into it and withdrew an old-fashioned bracelet of precious
  stones.
- '"How about the securities?"'
- Again Joe groped into the sack.
- His fingers encountered a bulky packet.
- 'When he pulled it out, the boys exclaimed in unison: "The bonds!"'
- The bundle of papers, held together by an elastic band, proved to be the securities.
- '"Mr. Applegate''s property!"'
- Frank cried out triumphantly.
- '"Joe, do you realize what this means?'
- We've solved the mystery!"
- The brothers looked at each other almost unbelievingly, then each slapped the other
  on the back.
- '"We did it!'
- We did it!"
- Joe cried out jubilantly.
- Frank grinned.
- '"And without old Smuff," he said.'
- '"Now Mr. Robinson''s cleared for sure!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"That''s the best part of solving this mystery."'
- '"You''re right!"'
- '"You go down first, Frank," said Joe.'
- '"I''ll toss the sack to you and then come myself."'
- They looked up to see an evil-looking, unshaven man peering down at them.
- '"Who are you?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"They call me Hobo Johnny," the man replied.'
- '"This here is my quarters and anything in it belongs to me.'
- You got no right in my room.
- You can't take anything away.
- And t'anks for finding the wad.
- I never thought to look around."
- Joe, taken aback a moment, now said, "You may sleep here, but this is railroad property.
- You don't own what's in this tower.
- Now go on down the ladder, so we can leave."
- '"So you''re going to fight, eh?"'
- Hobo Johnny said in an ugly tone.
- '"I''ll see about that!"'
- Without warning the trap door was slammed shut and locked from the outside!
- '"LET us out of here!"'
- Frank shouted at Hobo Johnny.
- '"You can''t get away with this!"'
- Joe yelled.
- The man on the water tower roof gave a loud guffaw.
- '"You think I ain''t got no brains.'
- Well, I got enough to know when I'm well off.
- I ain't in no hurry to collect that treasure you found in the tower.
- A few days from now will be all right for me to sell it."
- '"A few days from now?"'
- Joe exclaimed, horrified.
- '"By that time we''ll be suffocated or die of starvation."'
- Frank put an arm around his impulsive brother's shoulder.
- In a low tone he said, "We won't do either, Joe.
- I don't think it's going to be too hard to get out of here.
- If not by the trap door, we'll hack our way out through one side of the tank."
- Joe calmed down and both boys became silent.
- This seemed to worry Hobo Johnny, who called down, "What're you guys up to?"
- No answer.
- I'm leaving you now, but I'll be back for that treasure.
- Don't try any funny stuff or you'll get hurt!"
- The man on the roof waited a few moments for an answer.
- Receiving none, he shuffled across the tower to the ladder.
- '"I hope he doesn''t break all the rungs," said Joe worriedly.'
- '"We won''t be able to get down."'
- Again Frank patted his brother on the shoulder.
- '"I noticed an iron pipe running from the top of this tower to the bottom," he said.'
- '"If necessary, we can slide down the pipe."'
- '"How long do you think we should wait before trying to break out of here?"'
- Joe asked.
- Before replying, Frank pondered the situation.
- If not far, the boys might find him waiting below and a tough person to handle.
- '"I''d say that if we leave in fifteen minutes we''ll be safe," was Frank''s conclusion.'
- It would not budge.
- '"Where do we try next?"'
- Joe questioned.
- Frank was examining the seams around the trap door with the flashlight.
- Presently he pointed out a section where the wood looked completely dried out.
- '"It shouldn''t be too hard to ram a hole here, Joe.'
- Then you can boost me up, so I can reach through and turn the handle on the lock."
- There was a splintering sound.
- He gave the tool another tremendous push.
- The seam widened.
- Now he and Frank together wedged the end of the crowbar up through the opening.
- He found the handle which locked the trap door and turned it.
- Joe pushed up the door with the plank.
- The boys were free!
- Frank pulled himself up through the opening and hurried to the edge of the roof.
- He looked all around below.
- Hobo Johnny was not in sight; in fact, there was no one to be seen anywhere.
- '"Clear field ahead I" he announced.'
- Frank went back to the trap door and Joe handed up the sack, then joined his brother
  on the roof.
- The older boy went down the ladder quickly and his brother tossed the treasure to
  him.
- Joe lost no time in following.
- '"We''d better get away from here in a hurry!"'
- Frank advised, and both boys sprinted to their motorcycles.
- '"Let''s divide this stuff.'
- It'll be easier to carry," Frank suggested.
- He opened the sack and handed Joe the bundle of securities, which the boy jammed
  into his pocket.
- Frank stuffed the sack containing the jewelry into his own side pocket.
- It was not until they were several miles from the old water tower that the Hardys
  relaxed.
- Grins spread over their faces.
- '"I guess you''re right," Joe agreed.'
- '"And the most disappointed person is going to be one Oscar Smuff!"'
- '"What clue do you suppose he wanted us to follow?"'
- '"It''s my idea he didn''t have any.'
- '"Where do you think we ought to take these valuables?"'
- Joe asked presently.
- '"It''s wonderful!'
- Simply wonderful!"
- Mrs. Hardy cried out, hugging each of her sons.
- Their father's face wore a broad grin.
- '"I''m certainly proud of you," he said, and slapped Frank and Joe on the back.'
- '"You boys shall have the honor of making the announcement to the Apple-gates."'
- '"How about Chief Collig?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"And we''ll report Hobo Johnny to him."'
- '"And we''ll invite the Robinsons to hear the announcement," Joe added.'
- '"I didn''t think you''d do it!"'
- She never did like any of this business."
- Mr. Hardy was to see to it that Chief Collig released the man at once.
- '"This is going to be a lot of fun," Frank declared at supper.'
- '"Mother, I think you should come along?'
- Will you?"
- '"I''d love to," Mrs. Hardy replied.'
- '"I''d like to hear what the Applegates and Mr. Robinson and Chief Collig are going
  to say."'
- '"And Chet should be there too," Joe said.'
- '"After all, it was his stolen car that gave us the clue to Red Jackley."'
- Chet was called and gave a whoop of delight.
- He agreed to meet the Hardy family at the Tower Mansion.
- '"There''s one more person who ought to attend," said Frank with a twinkle in his
  eye.'
- '"Oscar Smuff.'
- I'd like to watch his face, too."
- '"At least we should tell him that the mystery has been solved," Joe spoke up.'
- Then Frank called Detective Smuff.
- At eight o'clock one car after another arrived at the Tower Mansion.
- When the Hardy family walked in they found all the Robinsons there.
- The twins rushed up to Frank and Joe and hugged them.
- '"You''ll never know what this means to us," she said.'
- Oscar Smuff was the last to arrive.
- Instantly he demanded to know what was going on.
- They're real heroes!"
- As Frank and Joe reddened in embarrassment, Detective Smuff looked at them disbelievingly.
- '"You mean the Hardy boys found the treasure?"'
- As all the others nodded, Slim spoke up, "This means that my father is completely
  exonerated."
- '"But how about that nine hundred dollars?"'
- Smuff demanded suspiciously.
- '"What''s the explanation of where your father got that?"'
- Mr. Robinson straightened up.
- '"I''m sorry," he said, "but I must keep my promise to remain silent about that
  money."'
- To everyone's amazement, Adelia Applegate arose and went to stand by the man's side.
- '"I will tell you where Robinson got that money," she said dramatically.'
- '"At my own suggestion I loaned it to him."'
- '"Yes, this was one time when I didn''t ask your advice because I knew you wouldn''t
  agree.'
- Then when the robbery took place, I didn't know what to think.
- I was sick over the whole affair, and I'm very, very glad everything's cleared up."
- Miss Applegate's announcement astounded her listeners.
- Robinson stood up, shook her hand, and said in a shaky voice, "Thank you, Miss Adelia."
- Hurd Applegate cleared his throat, then said, "I'd like to make an announcement.
- Will you all please sit down?"
- This whole robbery business has taught us a great lesson.
- In the future we're not going to be so standoffish from the residents of Bayport.
- '"I haven''t finished," Hurd Applegate went on.'
- '"I want to make a public apology to Mr. Robinson.'
- Adelia and I are extremely sorry for all the trouble we've caused him.
- We will increase your salary and we have decided to build that greenhouse you want.
- You'll have free rein to raise all the rare flowers you wish to."
- There was a gasp from everyone in the room.
- All eyes were turned on Mr. Robinson.
- Slowly he arose from his chair, walked over to Mr. Applegate, and shook his hand.
- '"No hard feelings," he said.'
- '"A thousand bucks!"'
- '"Dollars, Mr.'
- Adelia Apple-gate corrected him severely, "No slang, please, not in Tower Mansion."
- '"One thousand iron men," Smuff continued, unheeding.'
- '"One thousand round, fat, juicy smackers.'
- For two high school boys!
- And a real detective like me-" The thought was too much for him.
- He dropped his head in his hands and groaned aloud.
- Frank and Joe did not dare look at each other.
- They were finding it difficult to restrain their laughter.
- '"Yes, a thousand dollars," Hurd Applegate went on.'
- '"Five hundred to each boy."'
- Mr. Applegate now invited his guests into the dining room for sandwiches, cake,
  and cold drinks.
- As Frank and Joe ate, they were congratulated over and over by the others in the
  room.
- They hoped another mystery would soon come their way, and one did at THE HOUSE ON
  THE CLIFF.
- Frank had an instant answer.
- '"Put most of it in the bank."'
- Now we can do it.
- All right, Dad?"
- The detective smiled and nodded.
- '"An excellent idea!"'
