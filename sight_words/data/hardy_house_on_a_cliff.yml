- ' "So YOU boys want to help me on another case?"'
- Fenton Hardy, internationally known detective, smiled at his teen-age sons.
- '"Dad, you said you''re working on a very mysterious case right now," Frank spoke
  up.'
- '"Isn''t there some angle of it that Joe and I could tackle?"'
- Finally he turned back and gazed steadfastly at his sons.
- '"All right.'
- How would you like to look for some smugglers?"
- Joe Hardy's eyes opened wide.
- '"You mean it, Dad?"'
- '"Now just a minute."'
- The detective held up his hand.
- '"I didn''t say capture them; I just said look for them."'
- '"Even that''s a big assignment.'
- Thanks for giving it to us!"
- Frank replied.
- 'Tapping it, he said: "You boys have learned how to manipulate this telescope pretty
  well.'
- How would you like to take it out onto that high promontory above the ocean and
  train it seaward?
- The place I mean is two miles north of the end of the bay and eight miles from here."
- '"That would be great!"'
- '"Yes, I do," Mr. Hardy answered his tall, dark-haired son.'
- '"I strongly suspect that a man named Felix Snattman is operating in this territory.'
- I'll give you the whole story."
- Reports of thefts had come from various parts of the United States.
- Local police had worked on the case, but so far had failed to apprehend any suspects.
- '"Headquarters of the firm is in India," the detective told the boys.'
- '"It was through them that I was finally called in.'
- I'm sure that the thefts are the result of smuggling, very cleverly done.
- That's the reason I suspect Snattman.
- He's a noted criminal and has been mixed up in smuggling rackets before.
- He served a long term in prison, and after being released, dropped out of sight."
- '"And you think he''s working around Bayport?"'
- Joe asked.
- He whistled.
- '"That doesn''t make this town a very healthy place to live in!"'
- '"But we''re going to make it so!"'
- Mr. Hardy declared, a ring of severity in his voice.
- '"Just where is this spot we''re to use the telescope?"'
- Frank asked eagerly.
- '"It''s on the Pollitt place.'
- You'll see the name at the entrance.
- An old man named Felix Pollitt lived there alone for many years.
- He was found dead in the house about a month ago, and the place has been vacant
  ever since."
- Mr. Hardy glanced at his wrist watch.
- '"It''s one-thirty now.'
- You ought to be able to go out there, stay a fair amount of time, and still get
  home to supper."
- '"Oh, easily," Joe answered.'
- '"Our motorcycles can really burn up the road!"'
- His father smiled, but cautioned, "This telescope happens to be very valuable.
- The less jouncing it receives the better."
- Call them up."
- '"How about Chet and Biff?"'
- Joe consulted Frank.
- As his brother nodded, he said, "You pack the telescope on your motorcycle.
- I'll phone."
- Chet Morton was a stout, good-natured boy who loved to eat.
- Chet also loved to tinker with machinery and spent long hours on his jalopy which
  he called Queen.
- He was trying to "soup up" the motor, so that he could have a real "hot rod."
- In contrast to Chet, Biff Hooper was tall and lanky.
- '"As usual," Frank said with a grin as the two boys climbed on their motorcycles
  and set out.'
- Presently the Hardys stopped at Biff Hooper's home.
- He ran out the door to meet them and climbed aboard behind Joe.
- Chet lived on a farm at the outskirts of Bayport, about a fifteen-minute run from
  the Hooper home.
- The stout boy had strolled down the lane to the road and was waiting for his friends.
- He hoisted himself onto Frank's motorcycle.
- '"I''ve never seen a powerful telescope in operation," he remarked.'
- '"How far away can you see with this thing?"'
- '"It all depends on weather conditions," Frank replied.'
- '"On a clear day you can make out human figures at distances of twenty-four miles."'
- Chet exclaimed.
- '"We ought to be able to find those smugglers easily."'
- '"I wouldn''t say so," Biff spoke up.'
- '"Smugglers have the same kind of boats as everybody else.'
- How dose do you have to be to identify a person?"
- '"Oh, about two and a half miles," Joe answered.'
- The motorcycles chugged along the shore road, with Frank watching his speedometer
  carefully.
- '"We ought to be coming to the Pollitt place soon," he said finally.'
- '"Keep your eyes open, fellows."'
- The boys rode on in silence, but suddenly they all exclaimed together, "There it
  is!"
- Frank and Joe turned into the driveway.
- The only part of the house they could see was the top of the roof.
- Finally, beyond a lawn overgrown with weeds, they came upon the tall, rambling building.
- It stood like a beacon high above the water.
- Pounding surf could be heard far below.
- '"This place sure looks neglected," Biff remarked.'
- Dank, tall grass grew beneath the towering trees.
- Weeds and bushes threatened to engulf the whole building.
- '"Creepy, if you ask me," Chet spoke up.'
- '"I don''t know why anybody would want to live here."'
- The house itself was in need of repair.
- Built of wood, it had several sagging shutters and the paint was flaking badly.
- Nevertheless, Frank unstrapped the carrying case and lugged it around to the front
  of the house.
- Biff and Chet exclaimed in admiration.
- '"Boy, that''s really neat!"'
- Chet remarked.
- He and Biff watched in fascination as Frank and Joe began to set up the telescope.
- First they unfastened the tape with which the tube and tripod legs were tied together.
- Joe turned the three legs down and pulled out the extensions to the desired height.
- Then Frank secured the tripod legs with a chain to keep them from spreading.
- '"What''s next?"'
- Biff asked.
- After doing so, Frank tightened the wing nuts on the tripod lightly.
- '"This''ll keep the whole thing from being top heavy," he pointed out.'
- '"And what''s this little telescope alongside the big one for?"'
- Chet queried.
- '"A finder," Frank explained.'
- '"It''s as clear as mud," Chet remarked with a grin.'
- He squinted through the ends of both the large and the small telescopes.
- '"I can''t see a thing," he complained.'
- Joe laughed.
- In a few minutes the Hardys had the fascinating device working.
- '"Not a boat in sight!"'
- He now began a running account of the scene he had just picked up.
- '"It''s not very clear .'
- '"What kind of boat?"'
- Joe put in.
- '"Looks like a cruiser ... or a cutter.'
- It's not moving.
- Want to take a look, Joe?"
- Frank's brother changed places with him.
- '"Say, fellows, a man''s going over the side on a ladder .'
- He's climbing into it."
- '"Can you see a name or numbers on the big boat?"'
- Frank asked excitedly.
- The boat's turned at a funny angle, so you can't see the lettering.
- You couldn't even if the weather was clearer."
- '"Which way is the man in the small boat heading?"'
- Biff asked.
- '"He seems to be going toward Barmet Bay."'
- Joe gave up his position to Biff.
- '"Suppose you keep your eye on him for a while, and also the big boat.'
- Maybe it'll turn so you can catch the name or number on the box."
- Chet had been silent for several moments.
- Now he said, "Do you suppose they're the smugglers?"
- '"Could be," Frank replied.'
- '"Wh-where did that come from?"'
- Chet asked with a frightened look.
- '"Sounded as if it came from inside," Frank answered.'
- The boys stared at the house on the cliff.
- A moment later they heard a loud cry for help.
- It was followed by another scream.
- '"Somebody''s in there and is in trouble!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"We''d better find out what''s going on!"'
- Leaving the telescope, the four boys ran to the front door and tried the knob.
- The door was locked.
- '"Let''s scatter and see if we can find another door," Frank suggested.'
- Frank and Joe took one side of the house, Biff and Chet the other.
- They met at the rear of the old home and together tried a door there.
- This, too, was locked.
- '"There''s a broken window around the corner," Biff announced.'
- '"Shall we climb in?"'
- '"I guess we''d better," Frank answered.'
- As the boys reached the window, which seemed to open into a library, they heard
  the scream again.
- JOE was first to slide through the broken window.
- '"Wait a moment, fellows," he called out, "until I unlock this."'
- No one was there and they ran into the large center hall.
- Frank shouted.
- '"Where are you?"'
- There was no answer.
- '"Maybe that person who was calling for help has passed out or is unconscious,"
  Joe suggested.'
- '"Let''s look around."'
- Now it was heaped high with empty boxes and crates.
- There was no one in any of the rooms and the Hardys and their two friends met again
  in the hall.
- '"The man must be upstairs," Frank decided.'
- He started up the front stairway and the others followed.
- There were several bedrooms.
- Suddenly Chet hung back.
- He wanted to go with his pals but the eeriness of the house made him pause.
- Biff and the Hardys sped from one to another of the many rooms.
- Finally they investigated the last of them.
- '"Nobody here!'
- What do you make of it?"
- Biff asked, puzzled.
- Chet, who had rejoined the group, said worriedly, "M-maybe the place is haunted!"
- Joe's eyes were searching for an entrance to the third floor.
- Seeing none, he opened three doors in the hall, hoping to find a stairway.
- He saw none.
- '"There must be an attic in this house," he said.'
- '"I wonder how you get to it."'
- '"Maybe there''s an entrance from one of the bedrooms," Frank suggested.'
- '"Let''s see."'
- The boys separated to investigate.
- Suddenly Frank called out, "I've found it."
- This in turn revealed a stairway and the group hurriedly climbed it, Chet bringing
  up the rear.
- The attic room was enormous.
- '"I guess that cry for help didn''t come from the house at all," Biff suggested.'
- '"What''ll we do now?'
- Look outdoors?"
- '"I guess we''ll have to," Frank answered.'
- He started down the steep stairway.
- Reaching the foot, he turned the handle of the door which had swung shut.
- To his concern he was not able to open it.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- '"Looks as if we''re locked in," Frank told him.'
- '"Locked in?"'
- Chet wailed.
- '"Oh, no!"'
- Frank tried pulling and pushing the door.
- It did not budge.
- '"That''s funny," he said.'
- '"I didn''t see any lock on the outside."'
- Suddenly the full import of the situation dawned on the four boys.
- Someone had deliberately locked them in!
- The cries for help had been a hoax to lure them into the house!
- '"You think somebody was playing a joke on us?"'
- Biff asked.
- '"Pretty rotten kind of joke," Chet sputtered.'
- Frank and Joe were inclined to think that there was more to it than a joke.
- Someone had seen a chance to steal a valuable telescope and two late-model motorcycles!
- '"We''ve got to get out of here!"'
- Joe said.
- '"Frank, put your shoulder to the door and I''ll help."'
- Fortunately, the door was not particularly sturdy and gave way easily.
- The other boys followed, running pell-mell through the hallway and clattering down
  the stairway.
- They dashed out the front door, leaving it open behind them.
- To their relief, the telescope still stood at the edge of the cliff, pointing seaward.
- '"Thank goodness!"'
- '"I''d hate to have had to tell Dad the telescope was gone!"'
- Frank rushed over to take a quick look through the instrument.
- It had occurred to him that maybe some confederate of the smugglers had seen them
  spying.
- The eyepieces from both the finder and the telescope tube had been removed!
- As he turned to tell the other boys of his discovery, he found that they were not
  behind him.
- Nobody stole them!"
- '"Thank goodness for that," said Frank.'
- '"If that thief is hiding inside the house, I''m going to find him," Joe declared
  finally.'
- '"I''m with you," said Frank, jumping up.'
- '"How about you, Biff, guarding the motorcycles and Chet taking charge of the telescope?'
- That way, both the front and back doors will be covered, too, in case that thief
  comes out."
- '"Okay," the Hardys'' friends agreed.'
- As Frank and Joe entered the front hall, Joe remarked, "There's a back stairway.
- If we don't find the person on the first floor, I'll take that to the second.
- You take the front."
- Frank nodded and the search began.
- Not only the first, but the second and attic floors were thoroughly investigated
  without results.
- '"There''s only one place left," said Frank.'
- '"The cellar."'
- This area also proved to have no one hiding in it.
- '"I guess our thief got away," Frank stated.'
- '"And probably on foot," Joe added.'
- '"I didn''t hear any car, did you?"'
- Maybe he went down the cliff and made a getaway in a boat," Frank suggested.
- In complete disgust the Hardys reported their failure to Biff and Chet.
- Then they packed up the telescope and strapped it onto Frank's motorcycle.
- '"We may as well go home," Joe said dolefully.'
- '"We''ll have a pretty slim report for Dad."'
- '"I haven''t had so much excitement in six months."'
- The boys climbed aboard the motorcycles.
- As the Hardys were about to start the motors, all four of them froze in the seats.
- From somewhere below the cliff came a demoniacal laugh.
- Involuntarily the boys shuddered.
- '"L-let''s get out of here!"'
- Chet urged.
- '"It may be another trap!"'
- Chet yelled after them.
- '"Come back!"'
- But the Hardys went on.
- It was actually in back of them!
- '"What gives?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Search me," his brother answered.'
- '"The ghost must have a confederate."'
- '"I''m glad it stopped, anyhow," said Chet.'
- '"It gave me goose pimples and made chills run up and down my spine."'
- Biff looked at his wrist watch.
- '"I really have to be getting home, fellows.'
- Sorry to break up this man hunt.
- Maybe you can take me to a bus and come back."
- The Hardys would not hear of this and said they would leave at once.
- They had gone scarcely a mile when the motor on Frank's cycle sputtered and backfired,
  then died.
- '"A swell time for a breakdown," he said disgustedly as he honked for Joe to stop.'
- Joe turned around and drove back.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- '"Don''t know."'
- Frank dismounted.
- '"It''s not the gas.'
- I have plenty of that."
- '"Tough luck!"'
- Joe said sympathetically.
- '"Well, let''s take a look at the motor.'
- Better get out your tools."
- As Frank opened the toolbox of his motorcycle, an expression of bewilderment came
  over his face.
- '"My tools!"'
- '"They''re gone!"'
- The others gathered around.
- The toolbox was indeed empty!
- '"Are you sure you had them when you left Bayport?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"Of course I did.'
- I never go anywhere without them."
- Biff shook his head.
- '"I suppose the guy who took the eyepieces stole your tools too."'
- Joe dashed to the toolbox on his own motorcycle and gave a cry of dismay.
- '"Mine are gone, too!"'
- '"THAT''S a shame, fellows," Chet Morton said.'
- '"This is sure your day for bad luck.'
- First the eyepieces from your telescope are taken and now the tools from your motorcycles."
- '"And all by the same person, I''m sure," Frank remarked grimly.'
- '"Some slick operator, whoever he is," Joe added gloomily.'
- '"I was working on the Queen this morning," he explained.'
- '"Good thing I happened to put these in my pocket."'
- '"I''ll say," Frank declared gratefully, taking the tools which Chet handed over.'
- He unfastened the housing of the motor and began checking every inch of the machinery.
- Finally he looked up and announced, "I guess I've found the trouble-a loose connection."
- Frank adjusted the wires and a moment later the vehicle's motor was roaring normally.
- '"Let''s hope nothing more happens before we get home," Biff said with a wry laugh.'
- '"I''ll second that," Joe said emphatically.'
- Joe's mind was racing with his throbbing motorcycle.
- In a few minutes he had far outdistanced his brother.
- Frank did not dare go any faster because of the telescope strapped onto his handle
  bars.
- Presently Joe reached a spot in the road where it had been cut out of the hillside
  on the right.
- There was a sharp curve here.
- '"What''s that?"'
- Joe cried out.
- Biff turned to look over his shoulder.
- '"A landslide I" he shouted.'
- Joe cried out in horror.
- He jammed on his brake and disengaged the engine.
- As he ran back to warn his brother, Joe saw that he was too late.
- Biff had rushed up and both could only stare helplessly, their hearts sinking.
- Frank and Chet came around the corner at good speed and ran full tilt into the landslide.
- Its rumbling sound had been drowned out by the pounding surf and their own roaring
  motor.
- The two boys, the motorcycle, and the telescope were bowled over by the falling
  rocks and earth.
- As the rain of debris finally stopped, Joe and Biff reached their sides.
- '"Are you hurt?"'
- Frank, then Chet, sat up slowly.
- Aside from looking a bit dazed, they seemed to be all right.
- '"Rock just missed my head," Frank said finally.'
- '"I got a mean wallop on my shoulder," Chet panted gingerly, rubbing the sore spot.'
- '"You fellows were lucky," Biff spoke up, and Joe nodded his intense relief.'
- '"How about the telescope?"'
- Frank asked quickly.
- '"Take a look at it, will you, Joe?"'
- Joe opened the heavily lined box and carefully examined the telescope.
- '"It looks all right to me," he said in a relieved voice.'
- '"Of course we won''t know for sure until we try other eyepieces in it.'
- But at least nothing looks broken."
- '"Oh, I''m okay," Chet insisted.'
- '"The rock that hit me felt just like Bender, that big end on the Milton High team.'
- He's hit me many a time the same way."
- Frank, too, declared that he felt no ill effects.
- '"Guess we''re all set now," Frank spoke up.'
- '"Biff, I''m afraid you''re going to be late getting home."'
- He chuckled.
- '"Who is she?"'
- Biff reddened a little.
- '"How''d you guess?'
- I have a date tonight with Sally Sanderson.
- But she's a good sport.
- She won't mind waiting a little longer."
- Again the four boys straddled the motorcycles and started off.
- A powerful speedboat came into view around the base of a small cliff about a quarter
  mile out.
- It was followed at a short distance by a similar, but larger craft.
- Both boats were traveling at high speed.
- '"Looks like a race!"'
- Joe called out.
- '"Let''s watch it!"'
- The boats did not appear to be having a friendly speed contest, however.
- That second boat is trying to stop the other one!"
- Frank exclaimed.
- '"It sure is.'
- Wonder what's up," said Joe tensely.
- '"I wish that telescope was working.'
- Can any of you fellows make out the names on the boats?"
- '"No," the others chorused.'
- The two men standing in the bow of the pursuing craft were waving their arms frantically.
- The first boat turned as if about to head toward the shore.
- But the moment of hesitation had given the pursuers the chance they needed.
- They were so close together that a collision seemed imminent.
- '"They''ll all be killed if they aren''t careful!"'
- Frank muttered as he watched intently.
- The lone man in the foremost craft was bent over the wheel.
- In the boat behind, one of the two men suddenly raised his right arm high.
- A moment later he hurled an object through the air.
- It landed in back of the engine housing in the center of the craft.
- At the same time the larger boat sped off seaward.
- '"What was that?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"I-" Suddenly a sheet of flame leaped high into the air from the smaller boat.'
- There was a stunning explosion and a dense cloud of smoke rose in the air.
- Swiftly the whole boat caught fire.
- The flames raced from bow to stern.
- '"That man!"'
- '"He''s alive!"'
- The boys could see him struggling in the surf, trying to swim ashore.
- '"He''ll never make it!"'
- Joe gasped.
- '"He''s all in."'
- '"We''ve got to save him!"'
- Frank cried out.
- THE Hardy boys knew that they had no time to lose.
- '"We''ll never reach him!"'
- Chet said, as the four boys dashed across the rocks and grass to the shore.
- Suddenly Frank cried out, "I see a rowboat up on the beach."
- '"We''d make better time in that!"'
- A huge rock jutting out of the water cut the cove off from the open part of the
  beach.
- '"We''d have to go up to that ridge and then down," Joe objected.'
- '"I''ll swim out."'
- '"I will too," said Biff.'
- The two plunged into the water and struck out for the stricken man.
- '"That man''s still afloat," Frank shouted as he looked out over the water.'
- Slipping and scrambling, Frank and Chet made their way down the slope.
- Rocks rolled and tumbled ahead of them.
- But finally they reached the bottom safely and examined the boat.
- It was battered and old, but evidently still seaworthy.
- There were two sets of oars.
- '"Grab hold!"'
- Frank directed Chet.
- The boys pulled the boat across the pebbles and into the water.
- Swiftly they fixed the oars in the locks and took their places.
- Pulling hard, Frank and Chet rowed toward the distressed swimmer.
- Presently they overtook Joe and Biff, who clambered aboard.
- The man had seen the boys and called feebly to them to hurry.
- Joe urged.
- '"He looks as if he''ll go under any second!"'
- The motorboat in the background was still blazing fiercely, flames shooting high
  in the air.
- The craft was plainly doomed.
- The boys pulled harder and the rowboat leaped across the water.
- '"He''s drowning!"'
- Chet shouted, as he bent to his oar again.
- Frank and Chet rowed the boat to the spot and leaned over the side to peer down.
- His head sagged.
- '"He''s unconscious!"'
- Biff whispered hoarsely, as he helped pull the victim into the boat.
- The man sprawled helplessly on the bottom, more dead than alive.
- '"We''d better revive him and get him to the hospital," said Frank.'
- '"I think he collapsed from exhaustion," Joe spoke up.'
- Frank and Chet took off their jackets and wrapped them around the wet figure.
- '"How about taking him to that farmhouse over there-along the road?"'
- Chet suggested.
- The others agreed.
- As Frank and Chet rowed toward the farm, the boys discussed the mystery.
- Who was the victim of the explosion and why had the men in the other motorboat tried
  to kill him?
- The man they had rescued lay face downward in the bottom of the boat.
- He was a slim, dark-haired man with sharp, clean-cut features, and his clothes were
  cheap and worn.
- Biff looked in his pockets for identification but found none.
- '"Wonder if he''s a local man," Joe said.'
- '"Never saw him around town."'
- The other boys declared they never had either.
- By this time the boat was close to shore.
- Joe and Biff leaped out and dragged it part way up on the beach.
- Then the four boys carried the unconscious man up the rocky shore toward the farmhouse.
- At their approach a plump woman came hurrying out of the house.
- From the orchard nearby a burly man in overalls came forward.
- '"My goodness!'
- What has happened?"
- '"We just pulled this man out of the water," Frank explained.'
- '"We saw your house-" "Bring him in," boomed the farmer.'
- '"Bring him right in."'
- The woman ran ahead and held the door open.
- The farmer's wife hastened to the kitchen to prepare a hot drink.
- '"Rub his ankles and wrists, and get those wet clothes off him," the farmer told
  the boys.'
- '"That will step up his circulation.'
- I'll get him some pajamas."
- '"How about calling a doctor?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"No need.'
- He'll be okay," the farmer declared.
- The victim was soon under the covers.
- Frank and Joe continued to massage his wrists and ankles.
- At last the stranger stirred feebly.
- His eyelids fluttered.
- His lips moved, but no words came.
- Then his eyes opened and the man stared at those around him, as though in a daze.
- '"Where am I?"'
- '"You''re safe," Frank assured him.'
- '"You''re with friends."'
- '"You saved me?"'
- '"Pretty near-cashed in-didn''t I?"'
- '"You nearly drowned, but you''re all right now.'
- When you feel like talking, you can tell us the whole story," said Frank.
- The man in the bed blinked and looked out the window.
- Finally he said, "No, no.
- Don't do that."
- The boys were shocked.
- '"Why not?"'
- Joe burst out.
- I'll take care of it as soon as I get my strength back."
- The rescued man turned to the farmer.
- '"Okay with you if I stay here overnight?'
- I'll pay you, of course."
- The farmer put out his hand.
- '"The name''s Kane and you''re welcome to stay until you feel strong.'
- Nobody can say I ever turned a sick man away.
- And what's your name?"
- The patient hesitated a moment.
- Bill Jones," he said at last.
- It was so evidently a false name that the Hardys glanced knowingly at each other.
- Mr. Kane did not seem to realize that his guest was apparently trying to hide his
  identity.
- Mrs. Kane appeared with hot broth and toast.
- She suggested that her husband and the boys let the patient rest for a while.
- When she joined them in the living room she invited the boys to have a snack.
- Chet readily accepted for all of them.
- Chet beamed.
- '"Mrs. Kane, you ought to open a restaurant.'
- I'd be a steady customer.
- You're the best pie maker I've ever met."
- Frank, Joe, and Biff chuckled.
- How often they had heard their stout, food-loving chum make similar remarks!
- But in this case they had to agree with him and told Mrs. Kane so.
- She smiled.
- '"It''s the least I can do for you boys who just saved someone''s life."'
- '"Sure I knew Felix Pollitt," the farmer replied.'
- '"Closemouthed old codger, but I did hear him once say somethin'' about havin''
  a no-good nephew.'
- '"But who''d want the place?"'
- Mrs. Kane spoke up.
- '"It''s falling apart and would cost a mint of money to fix up."'
- Joe grinned.
- '"Sounds like a haunted house," he remarked pointedly.'
- '"Funny you should say that."'
- Mrs. Kane looked at Joe.
- '"There was a family stopped here the other day.'
- Wanted to buy some eggs.
- One of the little girls said they'd had a terrible scare.
- Mr. Kane's face broke into a grin.
- '"The kid''s imagination sure was runnin'' away with itself."'
- '"I''m not so sure of that," his wife disagreed.'
- '"I think some boys were in there playing pranks."'
- Biff frowned.
- '"If those ghosts are from Bayport High, they''ll sure have the laugh on us," he
  remarked.'
- '"They sure will," Chet agreed.'
- '"I''d hate to face them on Monday."'
- Frank and Joe were not convinced.
- '"I''m sure that ghost business was meant to be something more than a prank," Frank
  stated.'
- '"Right," his brother agreed.'
- '"I just had an idea, Frank.'
- What say we go back sometime and take a look?"
- '"I''m with you."'
- The large two-story garage at the rear of an attractive garden had once been a barn.
- Frank and Joe parked their motorcycles, unstrapped the telescope, and carried it
  to the back porch.
- '"Hello, boys," she greeted them.'
- '"Did you have a good day?'
- See any smugglers?"
- They kissed her and Frank said, "We have a lot to tell you and Dad."
- '"He''s in the study upstairs.'
- '"We sure fell for that cry for help," Joe explained.'
- '"I''m sorry about the stolen eyepieces from the telescope."'
- '"And I hope it wasn''t damaged when I had my spill," Frank added.'
- He smiled wanly.
- '"You''ll probably want to dismiss us from your detective force."'
- '"Nothing of the kind," his father said.'
- '"But now, let''s discuss what you saw through the telescope.'
- You said you spotted a man who climbed down the ladder of a boat and went off in
  a smaller one.
- Could he have been this same fellow who calls himself Jones?"
- '"We couldn''t identify him," Joe replied, "but he might be."'
- Frank snapped his fingers.
- '"Yes, and he could be one of the smugglers."'
- '"But who threw that hand grenade at him?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Not one of his own gang, surely.'
- And those guys in the other speedboat-they couldn't have been Coast Guard men, even
  in disguise.
- They wouldn't use grenades."
- '"Joe''s right on the second point," Mr. Hardy agreed.'
- '"But Jones may still be a smuggler."'
- Joe asked.
- The detective nodded.
- The boys were excited.
- Both jumped from their chairs and Joe cried out eagerly, "Let's go talk to him right
  away!
- By morning he'll be gone!"
- '"Just a minute!"'
- Mrs. Hardy said to her sons.
- '"How about supper?"'
- '"We can eat when we come back from our interview with Jones," Joe answered.'
- '"Mother, he may decide to leave the farmhouse any time."'
- Despairingly Mrs. Hardy returned to her husband.
- '"What do you think, Fenton?"'
- The detective gave his wife an understanding smile, then turned to Frank and Joe.
- '"Didn''t you say Jones was in pretty bad shape?"'
- '"Yes, Dad," Frank replied.'
- I'm sure that it'll be safe for us to eat Mother's good supper and still see our
  man in time."
- As a matter of fact, I have an empty space inside of me big enough to eat two suppers!"
- He smiled at her affectionately, then asked what he could do to help with supper.
- '"Very little," the detective replied.'
- '"Snattman is a slippery individual.'
- He covers his tracks well.
- I did find this out, though.
- '"Mr. Kane said he''d heard Mr. Pollitt call his nephew a no-good," Frank put in.'
- '"That''s just the point," Mr. Hardy said.'
- '"The lawyers learned from the police that he''s a hoodlum and is wanted for burglary."'
- Frank whistled.
- '"That puts the nephew in a bad spot, doesn''t it?'
- If he shows up to claim the property, he'll be nabbed as a criminal."
- '"Exactly," Mr. Hardy answered.'
- '"What will become of the property?"'
- Joe queried.
- '"They could do this on a month-to-month basis.'
- This would give added income to the estate."
- '"Which wouldn''t do the nephew much good if he were in jail," Mrs. Hardy put in.'
- '"That would depend on how long his sentence was," her husband said.'
- '"He may not be a dangerous criminal.'
- '"In that case," Frank remarked, "he may realize that he wouldn''t have to stay
  in prison long.'
- '"Well, I sincerely hope so," Mr. Hardy replied.'
- The detective smiled.
- '"The best way to avoid such a situation is never to get into it!"'
- At this moment the phone rang and Frank went to answer it.
- '"It''s for you, Dad!"'
- Mr. Hardy spent nearly fifteen minutes in conversation with the caller.
- In the meantime, the boys and Mrs. Hardy finished their supper.
- '"More drugs have disappeared," he said tersely.'
- '"I''m positive now that Snattman is behind all this."'
- '"Were the drugs stolen around here?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"We don''t know," his father answered.'
- '"A pharmaceutical house in the Midwest was expecting a shipment of rare drugs from
  India.'
- When the package arrived, only half the order was there.
- '"How were the drugs sent to this country?"'
- Joe queried.
- '"They came by ship."'
- '"To which port?"'
- '"New York.'
- But the ship did stop at Bayport."
- '"How long ago was this?"'
- '"Nearly two months ago.'
- '"You''re right," Mr. Hardy agreed.'
- '"Each time drugs are reported missing, there''s a new angle to the case.'
- Although I'm convinced Snattman is back of it, how to prove this is really a stickler."
- He smiled.
- '"I''ll tell you all a little secret.'
- I have a very good Mend down on the waterfront.
- He picks up many kinds of information for me.
- His name is Pretzel Pete."
- '"Pretzel Pete!"'
- Frank and Joe cried out.
- '"What a name!"'
- '"That''s his nickname along the waterfront," Mr. Hardy told them.'
- He laughed.
- He brought his black sedan from the garage and the boys hopped in.
- It did not take long to cover the six miles to the place where Jones was spending
  the night.
- '"Why, the house is dark," Frank remarked, puzzled.'
- '"Maybe everyone''s asleep," Joe suggested.'
- '"This early?"'
- Frank protested.
- Mr. Hardy continued on down the lane.
- There was no sign of anyone around the place.
- Frank remarked that perhaps the farmer and his wife had gone out for the evening.
- '"But I''m surprised that they would leave Jones alone in his condition," he added.'
- '"I''m quite sure they wouldn''t," his father averred.'
- '"If they''re asleep, I''m afraid we''ll have to wake them."'
- He pulled up in front of the kitchen entrance.
- Frank was out of the car in an instant, the others followed.
- He rapped on the door.
- There was no answer.
- '"Let''s try the front door," Joe suggested.'
- '"Maybe that has a knocker on it."'
- The boys walked around to the ocean side of the house.
- Although they banged loudly with the brass door knocker, there was still no response.
- '"The Kanes must have gone out," said Joe.'
- '"But what about Jones?'
- Surely he's here."
- '"And too weak to come to the door," Frank surmised.'
- '"But he could call out.'
- I can't understand it."
- The brothers returned to the back door and i reported to their father.
- Then, as Joe rapped several more times without response, a sinking feeling came
  over the brothers.
- '"I guess Jones recovered fast and has gone," Joe said dejectedly.'
- '"We''ve goofed."'
- '"Try the knob.'
- The door may not be locked," Mr. Hardy ordered.
- From his tone the boys knew that he shared their fears.
- Frank turned the knob and the door swung open.
- Mr. Hardy felt around for a light switch on the wall.
- '"We''ll go in," he murmured.'
- '"If Jones is here we''ll talk to him."'
- By this time the detective had found the switch.
- As the kitchen became flooded with light, the boys gasped, thunderstruck.
- On their previous visit they had been impressed by the neatness of the room.
- Now the place looked as though an earthquake had shaken it.
- Pots and pans were scattered about the floor.
- The table was overturned.
- A chair lay upside down in a corner.
- Shattered bits of cups and saucers were strewn on the floor.
- '"What happened?"'
- Frank exclaimed in bewilderment.
- '"There''s been a fight-or a struggle of some kind," said Mr. Hardy.'
- '"Let''s see what the rest of the house looks like."'
- The boys opened the door to the adjoining living room.
- Frank snapped on the wall switch.
- There a horrifying sight met the Hardys' eyes.
- The farmer and his wife, bound and gagged, were tied to chairs in the middle of
  the room!
- Swiftly Frank, Joe, and their father rushed over to Mr. and Mrs. Kane.
- In a minute the Hardys had loosened the bonds and removed the gags.
- '"Thank goodness!"'
- Mrs. Kane exclaimed with a sigh of relief, stretching her arms.
- Her husband, spluttering with rage, rose from his chair and hurled the ropes to
  one side.
- '"Those scoundrels!"'
- Frank hastily introduced his father, then asked, "What happened?"
- For several moments Mr. and Mrs. Kane were too upset to tell their story.
- But finally the farmer staggered over to the window and pointed down the shore road.
- '"They went that way!"'
- '"Follow them!"'
- '"Those thugs who tied us up!'
- They took Jones!"
- '"How long ago did those kidnapers leave?"'
- Frank asked the Kanes quickly.
- '"About ten minutes," replied the farmer.'
- '"Maybe you can catch them if you hurry!"'
- '"Come on, Dad!"'
- Frank cried.
- '"Let''s go after them!"'
- Mr. Hardy needed no further urging.
- He and his sons ran out of the house and jumped into the car.
- '"Yes," Mr. Hardy agreed.'
- '"It looks as though ''your friend Jones is mixed up in some kind of racket.'
- Those men must have been pretty desperate to risk breaking into an occupied house."
- The boys' father was able to follow the tracks of the car from the tread marks in
  the dusty road.
- Here they could get a clear view of the road winding along the coast for several
  miles.
- There was no sign of a car.
- '"We''ve lost them, I guess," said Frank in disappointment, as Mr. Hardy brought
  the sedan to a stop.'
- '"They had too much of a head start," Joe remarked.'
- '"If only we''d gotten to the farm sooner.'
- Well, we may as well go back."
- Mr. Hardy agreed, turned the car around, and once more the Hardys headed for the
  farm.
- '"If they are the kidnapers, I wonder what will happen to Jones now," Frank said
  gravely.'
- '"They tried to kill him once."'
- '"Maybe they''ll just hold him prisoner," Mr. Hardy stated thoughtfully.'
- Mrs. Kane was busy straightening up the kitchen.
- '"We couldn''t catch them," Frank reported sadly.'
- '"Well, those hoodlums had a high-powered car and they weren''t wastin'' any time.'
- '"Please tell us exactly what happened, Mr. Kane," Joe urged.'
- '"Well, Mabel and I were here in the kitchen," the man began.'
- '"Mabel was washin'' the supper dishes when this fellow came to the door.'
- He was a tall chap with a long, thin face."
- '"I got suspicious," Mr. Kane broke in.'
- '"He didn''t look nothin'' like Jones.'
- I asked him where he lived."
- '"At that," Mrs. Kane said, "he walked in the house with another fellow right at
  his heels.'
- They grabbed my husband.
- Henry put up an awful good fight but he was outnumbered.
- When I tried to help, a third man appeared from nowhere and held me back."
- '"Then we heard ''em goin'' into Jones''s room.'
- Pretty soon they carried him out to a car where a fourth fellow was sittin' at the
  wheel."
- '"Did Jones put up a fight when they took him away?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"He tried to.'
- He hollered for help, but of course I couldn't do anythin' and he was too weak to
  struggle much."
- '"This whole affair is very peculiar," Mr. Hardy observed.'
- '"Perhaps Jones is mixed up in the smuggling going on around here.'
- But who were those four men, I wonder?"
- Mrs. Kane shook her head.
- '"All I know is, we''re sure glad you and your sons came out tonight.'
- There's no telling how long we'd have been tied up before somebody found us!"
- '"We''re glad, too, that we got here," Frank replied.'
- '"You folks say your name''s Hardy?"'
- '"Any relation to Fenton Hardy?"'
- '"Right here."'
- The detective smiled.
- '"Pleasure to know you!"'
- '"If anyone can get to the bottom of this business, you can."'
- '"I''ll certainly try," the boys'' father promised.'
- The Hardys bade the farmer and his wife good-by.
- When they returned home the boys followed their father into his study.
- '"What do you make of all this, Dad?"'
- Joe asked.
- Mr. Hardy sat down at his desk.
- He closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair a few moments without speaking.
- '"I have only one theory," he said at last.'
- '"The kidnapers probably are Snattman''s friends.'
- The brothers were pleased with their progress.
- '"What do we do next, Dad?"'
- Joe asked eagerly.
- '"I want to evaluate this case from every angle," their father replied.'
- '"I''ll think about it and talk to you later."'
- With this the boys had to be content for the rest of the week end.
- In answer to the boys' inquiries, she replied, "Your father went out early this
  morning in his car.
- He didn't say when he would return.
- But your dad didn't take a bag with him, so he'll probably be back today."
- Frank and Joe were disappointed.
- They had looked forward to resuming a discussion of the case with their father.
- With pretty, dark-haired Iola was her best friend Callie Shaw.
- Callie, a blond, vivacious, brown-eyed girl, was Frank's favorite among all the
  girls in his class.
- '"How are the ghost hunters this morning?"'
- '"Iola told me about your adventures on Saturday."'
- '"Chet was really scared," Iola chimed in.'
- '"I think somebody played a good joke on all of you."'
- '"It was no joke," Joe said to Frank on the way home.'
- '"If any of the fellows at school had done it, they''d have been kidding us plenty
  by now."'
- '"Right," Frank agreed.'
- '"Joe, do you think the smugglers had anything to do with what happened at the Pollitt
  place?"'
- '"That''s a thought!"'
- '"That house on the cliff would be a great hide-out.'
- If the smugglers could make the house appear to be haunted, everyone would stay
  away."
- '"I wish Dad would get home, so we could take up this idea with him," Frank said
  thoughtfully.'
- But Mr. Hardy did not come home that day.
- '"Let''s not worry Mother about this," Frank said.'
- '"But if Dad''s not back by Wednesday-at the latest-I think we should do some inquiring.'
- Maybe Pretzel Pete will be able to help us."
- Joe agreed.
- On Tuesday afternoon the mystery of Mr. Hardy's absence took a strange turn.
- '"Come here, boys," Mrs. Hardy said in an apprehensive tone.'
- '"Look at this and tell me what you think."'
- She handed the note to Frank.
- '"What is it?"'
- '"Word from Dad?"'
- '"It''s supposed to be."'
- The boys read the note.
- It was typed on a torn sheet of paper and the signature looked like Fen-ton Hardy's.
- 'It read: I won''t be home for several days.'
- Don't worry.
- That was all.
- '"When did you get this, Mother?"'
- '"It came in the afternoon mail.'
- It was addressed to me, and the envelope had a Bayport postmark."
- '"Why are you worried?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"At least we''ve heard from Dad."'
- '"But I''m not sure he sent the note."'
- '"What do you mean?"'
- '"Your father and I have an agreement.'
- Whenever he writes me, he puts a secret sign beneath his signature.
- Frank picked up the note again.
- '"There''s no sign here.'
- Just Dad's signature."
- '"It may be his signature.'
- If not, it's a very good forgery."
- Mrs. Hardy was plainly worried.
- '"If Dad didn''t write this note," Joe asked, "who did and why?"'
- '"Your father has many enemies-criminals whom he has been instrumental in sending
  to prison.'
- '"Foul play!"'
- '"Then you think something has happened to Dad?"'
- JOE put an arm around his mother.
- '"Frank and I will start a search for Dad first thing tomorrow," her son said reassuringly.'
- Next morning, as the boys were dressing, Joe asked, "Where shall we start, Frank?"
- '"Down at the waterfront.'
- Let's try to find Pretzel Pete and ask him if Dad talked to him on Monday.
- He may give us a lead."
- '"Good idea."'
- The brothers reached the Bayport waterfront early.
- It was the scene of great activity.
- A tanker was unloading barrels of oil, and longshoremen were trundling them to waiting
  trucks.
- At another dock a passenger ship was tied up.
- Porters hurried about, carrying luggage and packages to a line of taxicabs.
- Many sailors strolled along the busy street.
- Some stepped into restaurants, others into amusement galleries.
- '"I wonder where Pretzel Pete is," Frank mused.'
- He and Joe had walked four blocks without catching sight of the man.
- '"Maybe he''s not wearing his uniform," Joe surmised.'
- '"You know, the one Dad described."'
- '"Let''s turn and go back the other way beyond the tanker," Frank suggested.'
- Suddenly Joe chuckled.
- '"Here comes our man."'
- Strolling toward them and hawking the product he had for sale came a comical-looking
  individual.
- He wore a white cotton suit with a very loose-fitting coat.
- Around his neck was a vivid red silk handkerchief, embroidered with anchors.
- The man wore a white hat which came down to his ears.
- On the wide brown band the name Pretzel Pete was embroidered in white letters.
- '"Boy, that''s some gear!"'
- Frank murmured.
- Pretzel Pete's garb was bizarre, but he had an open, honest face.
- He stopped calling "Pretzels!
- Hot pretzels!
- Best in the land!"
- He set down the large metal food warmer he carried.
- From the top of it rose three short aerials, each ringed with a dozen pretzels.
- '"You like them hot, or do you prefer them cold?"'
- Joe grinned.
- '"If they''re good, I can eat them any way."'
- Then he whispered, "We're Mr. Fen-ton Hardy's sons.
- We'd like to talk to you."
- At that moment a group of sailors brushed past.
- '"You''ve brought a message from your pop?"'
- Quickly Frank explained to him that their father seemed to be missing.
- '"We thought you might have heard this."'
- '"Yes, I did," Pretzel Pete answered.'
- '"But I didn''t think nothing about it.'
- I always thought detectives disappeared-sometimes in order to fool people they were
  after."
- '"They sometimes do," Joe told him.'
- '"But this time seems to be different.'
- '"Monday morning."'
- '"Dad has been gone ever since."'
- The man frowned, picked up a pretzel from one of the aerials, and began to munch
  on it.
- '"Help yourselves, fellows."'
- Frank and Joe each took one of the pretzels.
- They had just bitten into the delicious salted rings when Pete continued, "Now you
  got me worried.
- Your pop's a fine man and I wouldn't want to see anything happen to him.
- I'll tell you a place you might look for him."
- It was to be in a deserted farmhouse on Hillcrest something or other.
- I don't remember whether it was 'road' or 'street' or what."
- '"Was this last Monday?"'
- Frank asked eagerly.
- '"Oh, no," the vendor answered.'
- Joe broke in, "Dad must have thought the rest of the gang might be living there.
- Maybe they're holding him a prisoner!"
- '"Oh, I hope not," Pretzel Pete said worriedly.'
- '"But you fellows had better get right out there and take a look."'
- '"We certainly will," Frank told the man.'
- The brothers thanked Pretzel Pete for the information, then hurried home.
- Mrs. Hardy was not there, so they did not have a chance to tell her about their
  plans.
- '"We''ll leave a note," Frank decided and quickly wrote one.'
- Their hopes high, the brothers set off on their motorcycles on the search for their
  father.
- '"Suppose it''s not marked," said Joe.'
- '"We''ll never find it."'
- Frank gripped his handle bars hard.
- '"If Dad found it, we won''t give up until we do."'
- The motorcycles chugged past side road after side road.
- The farther away from Bayport the boys went, the farther apart these roads became.
- But just then, a short distance ahead, Joe saw a small car suddenly turn into the
  shore road.
- It seemed to have come right out of a clump of bushes and trees.
- '"Come on, Frank!'
- Let's investigate that place."
- The boys pushed ahead, hoping to speak to the driver of the car.
- But he shot down die road in the opposite direction at terrific speed.
- Suddenly he called back, "We're in luck, Joe.
- I see a homemade sign on a tree.
- It says Hillcrest Road."
- Frank returned to his brother and the boys trundled their machines up among the
  trees to hide them.
- Then they set off afoot along the almost impassable woods road.
- '"There aren''t any tire tracks," Joe remarked.'
- '"I guess that fellow who drove out of here must have left his car down at the entrance."'
- '"In fact, I think it might be better if we didn''t stay on this road but went through
  the woods."'
- Five minutes later they came to a clearing in which stood a ramshackle farmhouse.
- It looked as if it had been abandoned for many years.
- The young sleuths stood motionless, observing the run-down building intently.
- There was not a sound of activity either inside or outside the place.
- Picking up a large stone, he heaved it with precision aim at the front door.
- It struck with a resounding thud and dropped to the floor of the sagging porch.
- Frank's action brought no response and finally he said to Joe, "I guess nobody's
  home.
- Let's look in."
- '"Right," Joe agreed.'
- '"And if Dad''s a prisoner there, we''ll rescue him!"'
- The boys walked across the clearing.
- There was no lock on the door, so they opened it and went inside.
- The place consisted of only four first-floor rooms.
- All were empty.
- A tiny cellar and a loft with a trap door reached by a ladder also proved to have
  no one in them.
- '"I don''t know whether to be glad or sorry Dad''s not here," said Frank.'
- '"Or it could mean he''s still a captive somewhere else," Joe said.'
- '"Let''s look around here for dues."'
- The boys made a systematic search of the place.
- They found only one item which might prove to be helpful.
- It was a torn piece of a turkish towel on which the word Polo appeared.
- '"This could have come from some country club where they play polo," Frank figured.'
- '"Or some stable where polo ponies are kept," Joe suggested.'
- Puzzled, Frank put the scrap in his pocket and the brothers walked down Hillcrest
  Road.
- They brought their motorcycles from behind the trees and climbed aboard.
- '"What do you think we should do next?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"See Police Chief Collig in Bayport," Frank replied.'
- '"I think we should show him this towel Maybe he can identify it."'
- Half an hour later they were seated in the chief's office.
- Now Chief Collig gazed at the scrap of toweling for a full minute, then slapped
  his desk.
- '"I have it!"'
- '"That''s a piece of towel from the Marco Polo!"'
- '"What''s that?"'
- '"A passenger ship that ties up here once in a while."'
- Frank and Joe actually jumped in their chairs.
- The Hardys waited politely as he answered, hoping to discuss these new developments
  with him.
- 'But suddenly he put down the instrument, jumped up, and said: "Emergency, fellows.'
- Have to leave right away!"
- With that he rushed out of his office.
- Frank and Joe arose and disappointedly left headquarters.
- Mrs. Hardy shook her head.
- '"Fenton wouldn''t forget the secret sign.'
- As Frank and Joe appeared, the man introduced himself as Sam Bates.
- '"I''m a truck driver," he told them.'
- '"The reason I came around to see you is because I heard you were lookin'' for Mr.
  Hardy.'
- I might be able to help you."
- '"YOU''VE seen my father?"'
- Frank asked the truck driver.
- '"Well, I did see him on Monday," Sam said slowly, "but I don''t know where he is
  now."'
- '"Come in and sit down," Frank urged.'
- '"Tell us everything you know."'
- The four walked to the living room and Mr. Bates sat down uneasily in a large chair.
- '"Where did you see Mr.'
- Mrs. Hardy asked eagerly.
- But Sam Bates was not to be hurried.
- '"I''m a truck driver, see?"'
- '"Mostly I drive in Bayport but sometimes I have a run to another town.'
- That's how I come to be out there that mornin'."
- '"Out where?"'
- '"Along the shore road.'
- '"That was the day Dad left!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"Well, please go on with the story," Frank prodded Sam Bates.'
- '"Where did you see him?"'
- '"I was about half a mile from the old Pollitt place when I saw a man walkin'' along
  the road.'
- I waved to him, like I always do to people in the country, and then I see it's Mr.
- '"You know my father?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"Only from his pictures.'
- But I'm sure it was him."
- '"Dad left here in a sedan," Joe spoke up.'
- '"Did you see one around?"'
- '"No, I didn''t."'
- '"What was this man wearing?"'
- Mrs. Hardy asked.
- '"Well, let''s see.'
- Dark-brown trousers and a brown-and-black plaid sport jacket.
- He wasn't wearin' a hat, but I think he had a brown cap in one hand."
- Mrs. Hardy's face went white.
- '"Yes, that was my husband."'
- After a moment she added, "Can you tell us anything more?"
- '"I''m afraid not, ma''am," the trucker said.'
- '"You see, I was in kind of a hurry that mornin'', so I didn''t notice nothin''
  else."'
- He arose to leave.
- '"We certainly thank you for coming to tell us, Mr. Bates," Mrs. Hardy said.'
- '"Yes, you''ve given us a valuable lead," Frank added.'
- '"Now we''ll know where to look for Dad."'
- '"I sure hope he shows up," the driver said, walking toward the door.'
- '"Let me know if I can help any."'
- When the man had left, Joe turned to Frank, puzzled.
- '"Do you suppose Dad hid his car and was walking to the Pollitt house?'
- If so, why?"
- '"Something must have happened to him!"'
- Joe cried out.
- '"Frank, I''ll bet he went to Pollitt''s and that fake ghost got him.'
- Let's go look for Dad right away!"
- But Mrs. Hardy broke in.
- Her expression was firm.
- '"I don''t want you boys to go to that house alone.'
- Maybe you'd just better notify the police and let them make a search."
- The brothers looked at each other.
- The Pollitt line must have been disconnected.
- If Joe and I go out there and find him we can bring back a report."
- Mrs. Hardy gave a wan smile.
- '"You''re very convincing, Frank, when you put it that way.'
- All right.
- I'll give my permission, but you mustn't go alone."
- '"Why not, Mother?'
- We can look out for ourselves," Joe insisted.
- '"Get some of the boys to go with you.'
- There's safety in numbers," his mother said.
- The boys agreed to this plan and got busy on the telephone rounding up their pals.
- Phil owned a motorcycle.
- He and Tony said they could go along.
- Shortly after lunch the group set out.
- Chet rode with Frank, Biff with Joe, and Tony with Phil.
- The three motorcycles went out of Bayport, past the Tower Mansion, and along the
  shore road.
- All this time they had watched carefully for a sign of Mr. Hardy's car, but found
  none.
- '''Your dad hid it well," Chet remarked.'
- '"It''s possible someone stole it," Frank told him.'
- '"Sure is.'
- Good haunt for a ghost."
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"We''d better sneak up on the place quietly.'
- If we go any farther and the ghost is there, he'll hear the motorcycles.
- I vote we leave them here under the trees and go the rest of the way on foot."
- '"We''ll separate here," Frank decided.'
- '"Three of us take one side of the lane and the rest the other side.'
- When I whistle, you can come out of the bushes and go up to the house."
- '"That''s a good idea," Joe agreed.'
- '"Biff, Tony, and I will take the left side of the road."'
- The boys entered the weeds and undergrowth on either side of the lane.
- The six sleuths crept forward, keeping well in from the lane.
- After about ten minutes Frank raised his hand as a warning to Chet and Phil.
- He had caught a glimpse of the house through the dense thicket.
- They went on cautiously until they reached the edge of the bushes.
- From behind the screen of leaves they looked toward the old building.
- An expression of surprise crossed Frank's face.
- '"Someone''s living here!"'
- From where the boys stood they hardly recognized the old place.
- Weeds that had filled the flower beds on their last visit had been completely cleared
  away.
- Leaves and twigs had been raked up and the grass cut.
- A similar change had been wrought in the house.
- The hanging shutters had been put in place and the broken library window glass replaced.
- '"What do you suppose has happened?"'
- Chet whispered.
- Frank was puzzled.
- '"Let''s wait a minute before we go any farther."'
- The boys remained at the edge of the bushes, watching the place.
- A short time later a woman came out of the house carrying a basket of clothes.
- She walked over to a clothesline stretched between two trees and began to hang up
  the laundry.
- The boys looked at one another in bewilderment.
- They had expected to find the same sinister and deserted place they had visited
  previously.
- Instead, here was a scene of domestic tranquillity.
- '"There''s not much use in our hiding any longer," Frank whispered.'
- '"Let''s go out and question these people."'
- He gave the prearranged whistle.
- The other three boys appeared, and the entire group walked boldly up the lane and
  across the yard.
- The woman at the clothesline heard their footsteps and turned to face them, her
  hands on her hips.
- Her gaunt face wore an unpleasant scowl.
- '"What do you want?"'
- He was short and thin with close-cropped hair, and he needed a shave.
- His complexion was swarthy, his eyes narrow under coarse, black brows.
- At the same time another man came out of the kitchen and stood on the steps.
- He was stout and red-haired with a scraggly mustache.
- '"Yeah, who are you?"'
- '"We didn''t know anyone was living here," Frank explained, edging over to the kitchen
  door.'
- He wanted to get a look inside the house if possible.
- '"Well, we''re livin'' here now," said the redhaired man, "and we don''t like snoopers."'
- '"We''re not snooping," Frank declared.'
- '"We are looking for a man who has disappeared from Bayport."'
- '"Why do you think he''s around here?"'
- '"He was last seen in this neighborhood."'
- '"What does he look like?"'
- '"Tall and dark.'
- He was wearing a brown suit and sports jacket and cap."
- But Frank had reached the kitchen door.
- As he glanced in he gave a start.
- Hanging on a peg was a brown sports cap!
- '"I''M very thirsty," Frank said quickly to the occupants of the Pollitt house.'
- '"May I have a drink?"'
- The red-haired man and the woman looked at each other.
- They obviously wished to get rid of their visitors as soon as possible.
- But they could not refuse such a reasonable request.
- '"Come into the kitchen," said the man grudgingly.'
- Frank followed him through the door.
- As he passed the cap he took a good look at it.
- On it stood a plastic cup.
- '"Help yourself," he said gruffly.'
- Frank went across the room and ran some water from the faucet.
- As he raised the cup to his lips, his mind was racing.
- On his way out he glanced again at the peg.
- The cap was gone!
- Frank gave no sign that he had noticed anything amiss.
- He walked out into the yard and joined the other five boys.
- '"I guess we may as well be going," he said nonchalantly.'
- '"You might as well," snapped the woman.'
- '"There''s no stranger around here, I tell you."'
- The boys started off down the lane.
- When they were out of sight of the house, Frank stopped and turned to his companions.
- '"Do you know what I saw in that kitchen?"'
- '"Dad''s cap hanging on a peg!"'
- '"Then he has been there!"'
- '"They were lying!"'
- '"Yes," Frank continued, "and-and there were bloodstains on the cap!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"That means he must be in trouble.'
- Frank, we've got to go back!"
- '"We sure do!"'
- '"But I wanted to tell you all about it first."'
- '"What do you think we should do?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"I''ll ask those people in the house about the cap and force a showdown," Frank
  declared tersely.'
- '"We''ve got to find out where Dad is!"'
- Resolutely the boys started back to the Pollitt house.
- The woman caught sight of them and spoke warningly to the red-haired man.
- '"What do you want now?"'
- '"We want to know about that sports cap in the kitchen," said Frank firmly.'
- '"What cap?'
- There's no cap in there."
- '"There isn''t now-but there was.'
- It was hanging on a peg when I went in for a drink."
- '"I don''t know anythin'' about no cap," persisted the man.'
- '"Perhaps we''d better ask the police to look around," Joe suggested.'
- The redhead glanced meaningly at the woman.
- The other man stepped forward.
- '"I know the cap this boy means," he said.'
- '"It''s mine.'
- What about it?"
- '"It isn''t yours and you know it," Frank declared.'
- '"That cap belongs to the man we''re looking for."'
- '"I tell you it is my cap!"'
- '"Don''t tell me I''m lyin''."'
- The red-haired man intervened.
- '"You''re mistaken, Klein," he said.'
- '"I know the cap they mean now.'
- It's the one I found on the road a few days ago."
- '"Guess you''re right, Red," Klein conceded hastily.'
- '"You found it?"'
- '"Sure, I found it.'
- A brown cap with bloodstains on it."
- '"That''s the one.'
- But why did you hide it when I went into the kitchen?"
- '"Well, to tell the truth, them bloodstains made me nervous.'
- '"Where did you find it?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"About a mile from here."'
- '"On the shore road?"'
- It was lyin' right in the middle of the road."
- '"When was this?"'
- '"A couple of days ago-just after we moved in here."'
- '"Let''s see the cap," Chet Morton suggested.'
- '"We want to make sure of this."'
- As Red moved reluctantly toward the kitchen, the woman sniffed.
- '"I don''t see why you''re makin'' all this fuss about an old cap," she said.'
- '"Comin'' around here disturbin'' honest folks."'
- '"We''re sorry if we''re bothering you," said Joe, "but this is a very serious matter."'
- Red came out of the house holding the cap.
- He tossed it to Frank.
- '"It''s Dad''s cap all right."'
- '"I don''t like the look of those bloodstains," said Joe in a low voice.'
- '"He must have been badly hurt."'
- '"Are you sure you found this on the road?"'
- Frank asked, still suspicious.
- '"You don''t think I''d lie about it, do you?"'
- Red answered belligerently.
- '"I can''t contradict you, but I''m going to turn this over to the police," Frank
  told him.'
- '"If you know anything more about it, you''d better speak up now."'
- '"He doesn''t know anything about it," shrilled the woman angrily.'
- '"Go away and don''t bother us.'
- Didn't he tell you he found the cap on the road?
- I told him to burn up the dirty thing.
- But he wanted to have it cleaned and wear it."
- The boys turned away, Frank still holding the cap.
- '"Come on, fellows," he said.'
- '"Let''s get out of here."'
- As the boys started down the lane they cast a last glance back at the yard.
- The woman and the two men were standing just where the" young sleuths had left them.
- The woman was motionless, her hands on her hips.
- Red was standing with his arms folded, and Klein, the swarthy man, was leaning against
  a tree.
- All three were gazing intently and silently after the departing boys.
- '"What are you planning to do next?"'
- Phil asked as he pulled his machine alongside Frank's.
- '"I''m going right to Chief Collig and tell him the whole story."'
- '"Okay, we''re with you!"'
- The boys rode directly to police headquarters and left their motorcycles in the
  parking lot.
- Chief Collig looked up as his six visitors were ushered into his office.
- '"Well," he said heartily, "this is quite a delegation!'
- What can I do for you?"
- Chief Collig looked grave.
- '"I don''t like the sound of this at all," he said finally.'
- '"We must find your father at once!'
- This cap is a good clue."
- The boys thanked the chief for his help and left.
- Chet, Tony, Biff, and Phil went their separate ways while Frank and Joe turned toward
  home.
- We didn't see them out in the ocean earlier-at least not both of them."
- '"That''s right.'
- They could have come right out from under the cliff."
- '"You mean, Frank, there might be a secret harbor in there?"'
- '"Might be.'
- Here's the way it could work.
- Frank spread his arms.
- '"The base is the old Pollitt place!'
- What more do you want?"
- '"But the house is on top of a cliff."'
- '"There could be a secret passage from the house to a hidden harbor at the foot
  of the cliff."'
- '"Good night, Frank, it sure sounds reasonable!"'
- '"And perhaps that explains why the kidnapers got away with Jones so quickly on
  Saturday.'
- But we didn't."
- '"You mean they turned in at the Pollitt place?"'
- '"Why not?'
- Probably Jones is hidden there right now."
- '"And maybe Dad too," Joe cried out excitedly.'
- '"That''s right.'
- I'm against just sitting and waiting for the state troopers to find him.
- '"I get you!"'
- Joe agreed enthusiastically.
- Some of the anxiety left her face as she listened to her sons' reassuring words.
- When she went to the kitchen to start preparations for supper, the boys went to
  phone Tony Prito.
- '"I wouldn''t miss it for anything," he said.'
- '"But I can''t go until afternoon.'
- Have to do some work for my dad in the morning.
- I'll meet you at the boathouse at two o'clock."
- '"Swell, Tony.'
- I have a job of my own in the morning."
- Chet called a few minutes later.
- As Frank finished telling him about the plan, he whistled.
- '"You fellows have got your nerve all right.'
- But count me in, will you?
- I started this thing with you and I'd like to finish it.
- We've got to find your father!"
- After Chet had said good-by, Joe asked his brother, "What's on for the morning?"
- '"I want to go down to the waterfront and talk to Pretzel Pete again.'
- He might have another clue.
- Also, I want to find out when the Marco Polo is due back here."
- Joe nodded.
- '"I get it.'
- You think something may be going on then?"
- By nine o'clock the following morning Frank and Joe were down at the Bayport docks.
- Pretzel Pete was not in evidence.
- '"We''d better be cagey about asking when the Marco Polo''s coming in," Frank cautioned.'
- '"The smugglers probably have spies around here and we''d sure be targets."'
- Acting as if there were no problems on their minds, Frank and Joe strolled along
  whistling.
- Once they joined a group of people who were watching a sidewalk merchant.
- The man was demonstrating little jumping animals.
- Frank and Joe laughed as they bought a monkey and a kangaroo.
- '"Iola and Callie will get a kick out of these," Joe predicted.'
- '"Say, Frank, here comes Pretzel Pete now!"'
- Joe whispered.
- '"Nobody can make pretzels like yours," Joe exclaimed.'
- '"Give me a dozen.'
- Two for my mouth and ten for my pockets."
- '"Not a thing, son."'
- Pete could talk without moving his lips.
- '"But I may know something tomorrow."'
- '"How come?"'
- '"The Marco Polo''s docking real early-five A.M.'
- I heard Ali Singh is one of the crew.
- I'll try to get a line on him."
- We'll be seeing you."
- '"And that''ll give those smugglers a real break in picking up the stolen drugs!"'
- Frank added.
- '"Maybe we should pass along our suspicions to the Coast Guard."'
- '"Not yet," Joe objected.'
- '"All we have to go on is Pretzel Pete''s statements about Ali Singh.'
- Maybe we'll learn more this afternoon and then we can report it."
- '"I guess you''re right," Frank concluded.'
- '"You have a point."'
- When Frank and Joe reached the Prito boat-house at two o'clock, Tony and Chet were
  already there.
- Tony was tuning up the motor, which purred evenly.
- '"No word from your dad yet?"'
- Tony asked.
- The Hardys shook their heads as they stepped aboard.
- The Napoli was a rangy, powerful craft with graceful lines and was the pride of
  Tony's life.
- '"Rough water," Frank remarked as breaking swells hit the hull.'
- Salt spray dashed over the bow of the Napoli as it plunged on through the white-caps.
- Bayport soon became a speck nestled at the curve of the horseshoe-shaped body of
  water.
- Reaching the ocean, Tony turned north.
- The boys could see the white line of the shore road rising and falling along the
  coast.
- Soon they passed the Kane farm.
- Two miles farther on they came within sight of the cliff upon which the Pollitt
  house stood.
- It looked stark and forbidding above the rocks, its roof and chimneys silhouetted
  against the sky.
- '"Pretty steep cliff," Tony observed.'
- '"I can''t see how anyone could make his way up and down that slope to get to the
  house."'
- '"That''s probably why nobody has suspected the place of being a smuggling base,"
  Frank replied.'
- '"But perhaps when we look around we''ll find an answer."'
- The boys eagerly scanned the formidable wall of rock.
- It was scarred and seamed and the base had been eaten away by the incessant battering
  of waves.
- There was no indication of a path.
- Suddenly Tony turned the wheel sharply.
- The Napoli swerved swiftly to one side.
- He gave it power and the craft leaped forward with a roar.
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- Frank asked in alarm.
- Tony gazed straight ahead, tense and alert.
- Another shift of the wheel and the Napoli swerved again.
- Then Chet and the Hardys saw the danger.
- There were rocks at the base of the cliff.
- Only Tony's quick eye had saved the Napoli from hitting it!
- They had blundered into a veritable maze of reefs which extended for several yards
  ahead.
- Tony's passengers held their breaths.
- But luck was with them.
- The Napoli dodged the last dangerous rock, and shot forward into open water.
- Tony sank back with a sigh of relief.
- '"Whew, that was close!"'
- '"I didn''t see those rocks until we were right on top of them.'
- If we'd ever struck one of them we'd have been goners."
- Frank, Joe, and Chet nodded in solemn agreement.
- Then, suddenly, Frank cried out, "Turn back!
- I think I saw an opening!"
- Tony swung the boat around.
- The opening which Frank had spotted was a long, narrow tunnel.
- It led right through the cliff!
- '"This might be the secret entrance!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"I think it''s large enough for the boat to go through," said Tony.'
- '"Want me to try it?"'
- Frank nodded tensely.
- '"Go ahead."'
- The boys looked about expectantly.
- Steep slopes covered with scraggly trees and bushes reached to the water's edge.
- But there was no path or indication that any human being ever came down to the pond.
- Suddenly Frank gave a gasp of surprise and said, "Look to my right, fellows."
- Among the thickets at the base of the steepest slope stood a man.
- He was very tall, his face was weather-beaten, and his lips thin and cruel.
- He stood quietly, looking at the boys without a shadow of expression on his sinister
  face.
- Upon realizing he had been observed, the man shouted, "Get out of here!"
- Tony throttled the engine and Frank called, "We aren't doing any harm."
- '"I said ''Get out!'''
- This is private property."
- The boys hesitated.
- '"Turn that boat around and beat it!"'
- '"And don''t ever come back here!'
- Not if you know what's good for you."
- The boys realized that nothing would be gained by argument.
- Tony slowly brought the boat around.
- '"Okay," Joe called cheerfully.'
- The stranger did not reply.
- '"He sure didn''t!"'
- Frank exclaimed.
- '"I expected him to start popping that gun at any moment!"'
- '"He must have an important reason.'
- Who and what do you suppose he is?"
- Tony asked in bewilderment.
- '"Fellows," Frank said thoughtfully, "I think that man might have been Snattman!"'
- Joe exclaimed.
- '"I think you''ve hit it!'
- That man had no reason to act the way he did unless he's covering up something."
- '"Something like smuggling, you mean," said Chet.'
- '"He must be Snattman or one of his gang."'
- '"Snattman, king of the smugglers!"'
- Tony whistled.
- '"You guys really get in some interesting situations!"'
- '"I''ll bet that he''s one of the fellows who chased Jones that day in the motorboat,"
  Joe cried.'
- '"And tried to kill him," Frank continued the thought.'
- '"Let''s get away from here!"'
- Chet urged.
- '"Why should we go now?"'
- Frank demanded.
- '"We''ve stumbled on something important.'
- That hidden pond may be the smugglers' base."
- '"But if they use the house how do they get to it?"'
- Tony asked.
- '"Those cliffs up from the pond were mighty steep."'
- '"There must be some other way that we couldn''t see," Joe said.'
- '"What say we hang around here for a while and find out what we can?"'
- Tony caught the Hardys' enthusiasm and agreed to keep the motorboat in the vicinity
  of the cliff.
- '"Let''s run back to the bay and cruise up and down a while, then return."'
- Chet sighed.
- '"I''m glad none of you argued with that armed man."'
- '"Right," Joe replied.'
- '"As it is, he must think we were simply out for a cruise and wandered into that
  tunnel by mistake."'
- '"Yes," his brother agreed.'
- '"If he''d known we''re hunting for Dad, he might have acted very differently."'
- In the late afternoon Tony took the Napoli back to the suspected shore spot.
- Keeping well out from the breaking waves, he cruised along the cliff.
- The boys kept a sharp eye on the location of the tunnel.
- As the boat passed it they were just able to distinguish the narrow opening in the
  rocks.
- '"I won''t be able to go in there after a while," Tony remarked.'
- '"The tide''s coming in.'
- At high tide I'll bet that tunnel is filled with water."
- Suddenly Tony swung his craft so hard to the right that the other boys lost their
  balance.
- '"Sorry, fellows," he said.'
- '"Saw a log-oh!"'
- He shut off his engine in a flash and leaned over the gunwale.
- His companions picked themselves up and asked what had happened.
- '"Propeller started to foul up with some wire on that log."'
- Tony began to peel off his clothes.
- '"Get me some pliers, will you?"'
- Frank opened a locker and found a pair.
- Taking them, Tony dived overboard.
- A minute later he reappeared and climbed in.
- '"I''m lucky," he said.'
- '"Just plain lucky.'
- '"Good night!"'
- Chet exclaimed.
- '"It would have been a long swim home."'
- Joe slapped Tony on the back.
- '"Good work, boy.'
- I'd hate to see the Napoli out of commission."
- Chet and Frank hauled the log aboard, so it would not damage any other craft.
- '"This is a fence post with barbed wire!"'
- Chet said.
- It's good you spotted that log, Tony."
- Tony dressed, then started the engine.
- They could see the Pollitt house, but to their amazement no lights appeared in it
  as twilight came.
- '"How much longer do you think we should stay out here?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"I''m getting hungry."'
- '"I have a few pretzels and a candy bar, but that''s not much for four of us," Joe
  remarked.'
- '"I have a surprise for you!'
- I stowed away a little food before we took off."
- '"You deserve a medal," Chet remarked as he bit into a layer of ham and cheese.'
- '"You sure do!"'
- Frank agreed.
- '"I think we should stay right here for a while and watch.'
- It's my guess the smugglers will be on the job tonight.
- Don't forget that the Marco Polo is docking tomorrow morning."
- '"I get it," said Chet.'
- '"Correct," said Frank.'
- Tony looked intently at the Hardys.
- '"Is it your idea to keep Snattman from meeting Ali Singh?'
- But what about your father?
- I thought we came out here to get a line on how to rescue him."
- Twilight deepened into darkness and lights could be seen here and there through
  the haze.
- The cliff was only a black smudge and the house above was still unlighted.
- Suddenly the boys heard a muffled sound.
- Tony slowed the Napoli and they listened intently.
- '"Another motorboat," Tony whispered.'
- The sound seemed to come from near the cliff.
- '"Can you head over that way, Tony?"'
- Frank asked in a low voice.
- '"And could you take a chance on turning off our lights?"'
- Here goes.
- The wind's blowing from the land, so our engine won't be heard from the shore."
- The boys were tense with excitement as the Napoli moved slowly toward the light.
- As the boat crept nearer the cliff, they could barely distinguish the outline of
  a motorboat.
- The craft seemed to be making its way carefully out of the very face of the cliff.
- '"It must have come from that tunnel!"'
- Joe whispered to Frank.
- Finally the other boat slowed to a crawl.
- Then came the faint clatter of oars and low voices.
- The motorboat had evidently met a row-boat.
- '"Where can it be going?"'
- '"Out to meet the Marco Polo?"'
- '"Probably," Frank replied, "and we''d never catch it.'
- I wonder where the rowboat's going."
- The four boys waited in silence for several minutes.
- Then the rattle of oars came again.
- This time the sound was closer.
- The rowboat was coming toward them!
- '"What''ll we do now?"'
- Tony asked.
- '"Turn off your engine," Frank whispered.'
- Tony complied.
- Through the gloom suddenly came snatches of conversation from the rowboat.
- '"-a hundred pounds-" they heard a man say harshly, and then the rest of the sentence
  was lost.'
- There was a lengthy murmur of voices, then, "I don't know.
- It's risky-" The wind died down just then and two voices could be heard distinctly.
- '"Ali Singh''s share-" one man was saying.'
- '"That''s right.'
- We can't forget him," the gruff voice replied.
- '"I hope they get away all right."'
- '"What are you worryin'' about?'
- Of course they'll get away."
- '"We''ve been spotted, you know."'
- '"It''s all your imagination.'
- Nobody suspects."
- '"Those boys at the house-" "Just dumb kids.'
- If they come nosin' around again, we'll knock 'em on the head."
- '"I don''t like this rough stuff.'
- It's dangerous."
- '"We''ve got to do it or we''ll end up in the pen.'
- What's the matter with you tonight?
- You're nervous."
- '"I''m worried.'
- I've got a hunch we'd better clear out of here."
- '"Clear out!"'
- '"Are you crazy?'
- Why, this place is as safe as a church."
- The man laughed sardonically.
- '"Haven''t we got all the squealers locked up?'
- And tonight we make the big cleanup and get away."
- '"Well, maybe you''re right," said the first man doubtfully.'
- '"But still-" His voice died away as the boat entered the tunnel.'
- Joe grabbed Frank's arm.
- '"Did you hear that?'
- All the squealers locked up?
- I'll bet Dad's one of them and he's a prisoner somewhere around here."
- '"And this is the hide-out of Snattman and the other smugglers he was after," Frank
  added.'
- '"I don''t like this," Chet spoke up.'
- '"Let''s leave here and get the police."'
- Frank shook his head.
- '"It would take so long we might goof the whole thing.'
- Tell you what.
- Joe and I will follow that rowboat through the tunnel!"
- '"On foot or swim.'
- I don't think it's deep along the edges."
- '"You mean Chet and I will wait here?"'
- Tony asked.
- '"No," Frank answered.'
- '"You two beat it back to Bayport and notify the Coast Guard.'
- Tell them we're on the track of smugglers and ask them to send some men here."
- '"And tell them our suspicions about AH Singh and the Marco Polo," Joe added.'
- '"They can radio the captain to keep an eye on him."'
- '"Okay," said Tony.'
- '"I''ll do that.'
- First I'll put you ashore."
- '"Don''t go too close or you''ll hit those rocks and wreck the boat," Frank warned.'
- '"Joe and I can swim to shore.'
- Then we'll work around into the tunnel and see what we can find.
- Tony edged the boat in as close to the dark shore as he dared without lights.
- Quickly Frank and Joe took off their slacks, T shirts, sweaters, and sneakers.
- They rolled them up, and with twine which Tony provided, tied the bundles on top
  of their heads.
- Then they slipped over the side into the water.
- The Napoli sped off.
- Frank and Joe were only a few yards from the rocks and after a short swim emerged
  on the mainland.
- '"Well, here goes!"'
- Joe whispered, heading for the tunnel.
- CAUTIOUSLY Frank and Joe made their way across the slippery rocks.
- Suddenly there was a loud splash as Joe lost his footing.
- '"Are you all right?"'
- '"Give me your hand," Frank whispered and quickly pulled Joe back onto the rocks.'
- It was very dark in the shadow of the steep cliff.
- The waves breaking against the rocks had a lonely and foreboding sound.
- '"Good night!"'
- Joe muttered.
- '"Aren''t we ever coming to that tunnel?"'
- '"Take it easy," Frank advised.'
- '"It can''t be much farther."'
- '"I hope Tony and Chet will hurry back with help," Joe said.'
- '"This is a ticklish job."'
- '"Watch out!"'
- By this time they had reached the entrance to the tunnel.
- Frank turned to Joe.
- '"If we try to walk through all that stuff," he whispered, "we''re sure to be heard.'
- That is, if those men are in here some place."
- Joe grunted in agreement.
- '"What shall we do?"'
- Tentatively, Frank put one foot into the water from the rock on which he was standing.
- '"It isn''t deep," he said.'
- '"I guess we can wade through."'
- The boys hugged the wall and started off.
- The brothers' hearts beat wildly.
- What would they find ahead of them?
- The boys had not heard a sound since entering the tunnel.
- It appeared that the men in the row-boat had gone on to some secret hiding place.
- '"I think I''ll risk my flashlight," Frank said in a low voice as they reached the
  pond.'
- '"We can''t find out anything without it."'
- He pulled one he always carried from its waterproof case and snapped it on.
- The yellow beam shone over the pond.
- There was no sign of the rowboat.
- '"How do you think those men got out of here?"'
- Joe asked.
- '"Do you suppose there''s another opening?"'
- Frank turned the flashlight onto the steep sides surrounding the water.
- '"I don''t see any.'
- My guess is that those men hid the boat some place.
- Let's make a thorough search."
- They had about given up in despair as they reached the section by the far wall of
  the tunnel.
- Then, as Frank beamed the flashlight over the thicket, he exclaimed hoarsely, "Look!"
- '"A door!"'
- Joe whispered tensely.
- '"This explains it," Joe said.'
- '"The men in the boat went through here.'
- I wonder where it goes."
- In order to avoid detection, Frank extinguished his light before trying to open
  the door.
- He swung it open inch by inch, half expecting to find lights and people beyond.
- But there was only darkness.
- Luckily the door had made no noise.
- Frank turned on his light again.
- At the end was a tiny wharf with a rowboat tied to a post.
- '"This is fantastic!"'
- Joe whispered.
- '"And it must have been here a long time.'
- Do you suppose it's connected with the Pollitt place?"
- '"If it is, it could mean old Mr. Pollitt was mixed up with the smugglers!"'
- Frank answered.
- '"Hey, do you suppose Snattman is his nephew?"'
- Excited over this possible new angle to the case, Frank and Joe stepped onto the
  ledge.
- They dressed, then quietly inched forward.
- Reaching the wharf, they looked about them as Frank beamed his flashlight on the
  walls.
- '"Hold it!"'
- Joe whispered.
- Directly ahead was a crude arch in the rock.
- Beyond it, the boys could see a steep flight of stone steps.
- Their hearts pounded with excitement.
- '"We''ve found it!"'
- Frank whispered.
- '"This must be the secret passageway!"'
- '"Let''s go up."'
- The light cast strange shadows in the passage through the rocks.
- Water dripped from the walls.
- The boys tiptoed forward and stealthily began the ascent.
- As they crept up the stairs, Frank flashed the light ahead of them.
- Shortly they could see that the steps ended at a heavy door.
- Its framework was set into the wall of rock.
- Above them was only a rocky ceiling.
- When Frank and Joe reached the door, they hesitated.
- But, on the other hand, we must find Dad!"
- Frank stepped forward, pressed his ear against the door, and listened intently.
- There was not a sound beyond.
- There was only darkness.
- '"I guess there''s no one inside," he said to Joe.'
- '"Let''s see if we can open it."'
- Frank felt for the latch.
- The door did not move.
- '"It must be locked," he whispered.'
- '"Try it again.'
- Maybe it's just stuck."
- Frank put his hand on the latch, this time also pushing the door with his shoulder.
- Suddenly, with a noise which echoed from wall to wall, the latch snapped and the
  door swung open.
- Joe stepped forward, but Frank put out a restraining hand.
- '"That noise may bring someone."'
- Tensely, they stood alert for the slightest sound.
- But none came.
- Hopeful that there was no one in the area beyond, Frank switched on the flashlight.
- The boys wondered if it had been a natural cave.
- '"Smuggled goods!"'
- Frank and Joe thought.
- They saw none.
- Was this the end of the trail?
- '"But it couldn''t be," the young sleuths thought.'
- '"Those men went some place."'
- Bolts of beautiful silk had been tossed on top of some of the bales.
- Valuable tapestries were also lying carelessly around.
- In one corner four boxes were piled on top of one another.
- Frank accidentally knocked the flashlight against one of these and it gave forth
  a hollow sound.
- '"It''s empty," he whispered.'
- He mentioned his suspicion to Joe.
- '"But how could the men pile the boxes up there after they went out?"'
- '"This gang is smart enough for anything.'
- Let's move these boxes away and maybe we'll find out."
- Frank seized the topmost box.
- It was very light and he removed it from the pile without difficulty.
- '"I thought so!"'
- Frank said with satisfaction.
- The flashlight had revealed the top of a door which had been hidden from view.
- The boys lost no time in moving the other three boxes.
- '"Very clever," Joe remarked.'
- Well, let's see where the door leads," Frank proposed.
- He snapped off his light and with utmost caution opened the door.
- It made no sound.
- Again there was darkness ahead.
- '"What a maze!"'
- Frank whispered as he turned on his flash and beamed the light ahead.
- Another stone-lined passage with a flight of steps at the end!
- Suddenly Frank stiffened and laid a warning hand on his brother's arm.
- The boys listened intently.
- They could hear a man's voice in the distance.
- Then, to the brothers' alarm, they heard footsteps.
- Hastily they retreated into the secret cave.
- The door!"
- Frank urged.
- They closed it quietly.
- '"Now the boxes.'
- If those men come in here they'll notice that the boxes have been moved!"
- He turned on the light but shielded it with his hand.
- Finally the topmost box was in place.
- '"Out the other door!"'
- Frank hissed into Joe's ear.
- '"We haven''t time," Frank whispered.'
- The beam of the flashlight revealed a number of boxes close to the door.
- On top of these someone had thrown a heavy bolt of silk, the folds of which hung
  down to the floor.
- The brothers scrambled swiftly behind the boxes, pressing themselves close against
  the wall.
- '"We''ll take it upstairs.'
- Burke says he can get rid of it for us right away.
- No use leaving it down here.
- Got to make room for the new shipment."
- '"Right," the Hardys heard someone else reply.'
- '"Anything else to go up?"'
- I'll switch on the light."
- There was a click, and suddenly the cave was flooded with light.
- It had been wired for electricity.
- Frank and Joe crouched in their hiding place, holding their breaths in terror.
- Would they be discovered?
- Footsteps slowly approached the boxes behind which they were concealed!
- '"Here''s some o'' that Japanese silk," the boys heard one of the men say.'
- '"I''d better take a bolt of that up too.'
- Burke said he could place some more of it."
- Instantly the same thought ran through both the brothers' minds.
- If the man picked up the silk, they would surely be found!
- '"Don''t be crazy!"'
- '"You know you won''t get any credit for pushin'' a sale.'
- Why break your arm luggin' all that stuff upstairs?"
- '"Naw," his companion snarled.'
- '"I can tell you ain''t been with this gang long.'
- You never get any thanks around here for thinkin'.
- If Burke don't take the extra stuff, the boss'll make you bring it all the way down
  again."
- '"Maybe you''re right."'
- '"Sure I''m right!'
- My idea for the rest of us in this gang is to do just what Snattman tells us to
  and no more."
- '"You got somethin'' there, Bud.'
- We'll just take up the package of drugs and leave the rest."
- To the boys' relief the men turned away and went over to the other side of the room.
- Frank and Joe did not dare peer out, but they could hear the sound of boxes being
  shifted.
- Then came the words, "All set.
- I've got the packages.
- Let's go!"
- The switch was snapped and the cave was plunged into darkness.
- The Hardys began to breathe normally again.
- When they had died away completely, Frank switched on the flashlight.
- '"That was a close call!'
- I sure thought they had us."
- '"Me too," Joe agreed.'
- '"We wouldn''t have had a chance with that pair.'
- Looked like a couple of wrestlers."
- '"Do we dare follow them?"'
- '"You bet.'
- '"We''ll have to watch our step even more carefully.'
- We don't want to walk right into the whole ring of smugglers," Frank reminded him.
- I don't crave anything worse than what we've just gone through," said Joe.
- '"I thought I''d die of suspense while that pair was in here."'
- They crossed the room, opened the door, and started up the dark passageway.
- Presently they were confronted by the flight of steps.
- Part way up there was a landing, then more steps with a door at the top.
- '"I''ll go first," Frank offered.'
- '"Stick close behind me.'
- I think I'll keep the flash off."
- '"That''s right," Joe agreed.'
- '"Snattman might have a guard at the top and there''s no use advertising our presence."'
- Step by step, the boys crept upward in the inky blackness.
- Then they found themselves on a crude landing of planks.
- Here the brothers stopped again to listen.
- '"So far, so good," Frank whispered.'
- '"But somehow I don''t like this whole thing.'
- I have a feeling we're walking into a trap."
- '"We can''t quit now," Joe answered.'
- '"But I admit I''m scared."'
- Still groping in the dark, the boys climbed up and up until they were nearly winded.
- '"Where are we?"'
- Joe panted.
- '"I feel as if I''ve been climbing stairs for an hour!"'
- '"Me too," Frank agreed.'
- '"The cliff doesn''t look this high from the outside."'
- They rested a minute, then continued their journey.
- Groping around, they finally reached another door.
- Frank hunted for the door handle.
- Finding it, he turned the knob ever so slightly to find out if the door was locked.
- '"I can open it," Frank said in Joe''s ear, "but we''d better wait a few minutes."'
- '"Every second is vital if Dad''s a prisoner," Joe objected.'
- A chill ran down their spines.
- '"Shall we run?"'
- Joe said fearfully.
- '"It wouldn''t do us any good.'
- There came a queer shuffling sound and a sigh from somewhere beyond the door.
- That was all.
- '"Someone''s in there," Frank breathed.'
- Joe nodded in the darkness.
- The boys did not know what to do.
- The gang might have posted a sentry.
- If there was only one, the Hardys might be able to jump the man and disarm him.
- Frank and Joe gritted their teeth.
- They couldn't give up now!
- As they were trying to decide how to proceed, the situation took an unexpected turn.
- A door slammed in the distance.
- Then came the murmur of voices and the sound of advancing footsteps.
- '"This nonsense has gone far enough," a man said angrily.'
- '"He''ll write that note at once, or I''ll know the reason why."'
- The boys started.
- The voice was that of the man who had ordered them to leave the pond during the
  afternoon.
- '"That''s right, chief!"'
- '"Make him do as you say and get the heat off us until we''ve got all the loot moved."'
- '"If he doesn''t write it, he''ll never get out of here alive," the first man promised
  coldly.'
- Instantly Frank and Joe thought of the note their mother had received.
- Was the man these smugglers were talking about their father?
- Or was he someone else-maybe Jones, who was to be forced to obey them or perhaps
  lose his life?
- The speakers went a short distance beyond the door behind which Frank and Joe were
  standing.
- Then they heard the click of a switch.
- A faint beam of yellow light shone beneath the door.
- '"Well, I see you''re still here," said the man who had been addressed as chief.'
- '"You''ll find this an easier place to get into than out of."'
- A weary voice answered him.
- The tones were low, so the boys pressed closer to the door.
- But try as they might, they could not distinguish the words.
- '"You''re a prisoner here and you''ll stay here until you die unless you write that
  note."'
- '"You won''t write it, eh?'
- We'll see what we can do to persuade you."
- '"Let him go hungry for a few days.'
- That'll persuade him!"
- This brought a hoarse laugh from his companions.
- '"You''ll be hungry enough if you don''t write that letter," the chief agreed.'
- '"Are you going to write it?"'
- '"No," the boys barely heard the prisoner answer.'
- The chief said sourly, "You've got too much on us.
- We can't afford to let you go now.
- But if you write that letter, we'll leave you some food, so that you won't starve.
- You'll break out eventually, but not in time to do us any harm.
- Well, what do you say?
- Want some food?"
- There was no reply from the prisoner.
- '"Give his arm a little twist," suggested one of the smugglers.'
- At this the Hardys' blood boiled with rage.
- But they realized they were helpless against so many men.
- Their only hope lay in the arrival of the Coast Guard men, but they might come too
  late!
- '"Chief, shall I give this guy the works?"'
- '"No," the leader answered quickly.'
- '"None of that rough stuff.'
- We'll do it the easy way-starvation.
- I'm giving him one more chance.
- He can write that note now or we'll leave him here to starve when we make our getaway."
- Still there was no reply.
- To Frank's and Joe's ears came a scraping sound as if a chair was being moved forward.
- '"You won''t talk, eh?"'
- The leader's voice grew ugly.
- JOE gave a start.
- '"It is Dad!"'
- '"He found the smugglers'' hide-out!"'
- Frank nudged his brother warningly.
- '"Not so loud."'
- '"Write that note!"'
- Snattman demanded.
- '"I won''t write it," Fenton Hardy replied in a weak but clear voice.'
- The chief persisted.
- '"You heard what I said.'
- Write it or be left here to starve."
- '"I''ll starve."'
- '"You''ll change your mind in a day or two.'
- You think you're hungry now, but wait until we cut off your food entirely.
- Then you'll see.
- You'll be ready to sell your soul for a drop of water or a crumb to eat."
- '"I won''t write it."'
- '"Look here, Hardy.'
- We're not asking very much.
- They're too nosy."
- '"Sooner or later someone is going to trace me here," came Mr. Hardy''s faint reply.'
- '"And when they do, I can tell them enough to send you to prison for the rest of
  your life."'
- There was a sudden commotion in the room and two or three of the smugglers began
  talking at once.
- '"You''re crazy!"'
- '"You don''t know anything about me!"'
- '"I know enough to have you sent up for attempted murder.'
- And you're about to try it again."
- '"You''re too smart, Hardy.'
- That's all the more reason why you're not going to get out of here until we've gone.
- And if you don't co-operate you'll never make it.
- Our next big shipment's coming through tonight, and then we're skipping the country.
- If you write that letter, you'll live.
- If you don't, it's curtains for you!"
- Frank and Joe were shaken by the dire threats.
- '"You can''t scare me, Snattman," the detective said.'
- '"I have a feeling your time is up.'
- You're never going to get that big shipment."
- The detective's voice seemed a little stronger, the boys felt.
- Snattman laughed.
- '"I thought you were smart, but you''re playing a losing game, I warn you.'
- And how about your family?
- Are you doing them a service by being so stubborn?"
- There was silence for a while.
- '"You have a very high sense of duty," sneered Snattman.'
- '"But you''ll change your mind.'
- Are you thirsty?"
- There was no reply.
- '"Are you hungry?"'
- Still no answer.
- '"You know you are.'
- And it'll be worse.
- You'll die of thirst and starvation unless you write that note."
- '"I''ll never write it."'
- '"All right.'
- Come on, men.
- We'll leave him to himself for a while and give him time to think about it."
- Frank squeezed Joe's arm in relief and exhilaration.
- There was still a chance to save their father!
- Footsteps echoed as Snattman and the others left the room and walked through the
  corridor.
- Finally the sounds died away and a door slammed.
- Joe made a move toward the door, but Frank held him back.
- '"We''d better wait a minute," he cautioned.'
- '"They may have left someone on guard."'
- The boys stood still, listening intently.
- But there were no further sounds from beyond the door.
- At length, satisfied that his father had indeed been left alone, Frank felt for
  the knob.
- There was no sign of a guard.
- The passage was floored with planks and had a beamed ceiling like a cellar.
- Frank and Joe quickly figured where their father was and sped across the planks
  to the room.
- They pushed open the door of the almost dark room and peered inside.
- There was a crude table and several chairs.
- In one corner stood a small cot.
- On it lay Fenton Hardy.
- He was flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his prison.
- Frank and Joe cried softly.
- The detective had not heard the door open, but now he looked at his sons in amazement
  and relief.
- '"You''re here!"'
- '"Thank goodness!"'
- The boys were shocked at the change in their father's appearance.
- Normally a rugged-looking man, Fenton Hardy now was thin and pale.
- His cheeks were sunken and his eyes listless.
- '"We''ll have you out of here in a minute," Frank whispered.'
- '"Those demons may be back any minute!"'
- Frank pulled out his pocketknife and began to work at the ropes that bound his father.
- But the knife was not very sharp and the bonds were thick.
- Joe discovered that he did not have his knife with him.
- '"It probably slipped out of my pocket when we undressed on the Napoli," he said.'
- '"Mine''s gone too," Mr. Hardy told them.'
- '"Snattman took everything I had in my pockets, including concentrated emergency
  rations.'
- Have you anything sweet with you?"
- He saw nothing.
- Mr. Hardy finished the candy bar, bite by bite.
- Now Joe started to help Frank by trying to untie the knots.
- But they were tight and he found it almost impossible to loosen them.
- Minutes passed.
- Frank hacked at the ropes, but the dull blade made little progress.
- Joe worked at the obstinate knots.
- Fenton Hardy could give no assistance.
- All were silent.
- The only sound was the heavy breathing of the boys and the scraping of the knife
  against the ropes.
- At last Frank was able to saw through one of the bonds and the detective's feet
  were free.
- His son pulled the ropes away and began to work on the ones that bound his father's
  arms.
- It was a heavy footstep beyond the corridor door.
- Someone was coming back!
- Frank worked desperately with the knife, but the ropes still held stubbornly.
- The dull blade seemed to make almost no impression.
- But at last a few strands parted.
- The detective was free!
- But the footfalls of the approaching smuggler came closer.
- Frank whispered, as he flung the ropes aside.
- '"I-I can''t hurry!"'
- Mr. Hardy gasped.
- '"I''ve been tied up so long my feet and legs are numb."'
- '"But we''ve got to hurry, Dad!"'
- Frank said excitedly.
- '"See if you can stand up."'
- '"We must run before those crooks come!"'
- Joe said tensely.
- Fenton Hardy got to his feet as hastily as he could.
- But when he stood up, the detective staggered and would have fallen if Frank had
  not taken his arm.
- He was so weak from hunger that a wave of dizziness had come over him.
- He gave his head a quick shake and the feeling passed.
- '"All right.'
- Let's go," he said, clinging to both boys for support.
- The three hastened out the door of the room and across the corridor to the cave.
- As they entered it, Mr. Hardy's knees buckled.
- In desperation his sons picked him up.
- '"You go on," he whispered.'
- '"Leave me here."'
- '"I''m sure all of us can make it," Joe said bravely.'
- They reached the far door, but the delay had been costly.
- Frank and Joe had a confused glimpse of the dark man whom they had seen at the pond
  that afternoon.
- Two rough-looking companions crowded in behind him.
- '"What''s going on here?"'
- Snattman exclaimed, apparently not recognizing the group for a moment.
- '"It''s the Hardys I" one of the other men cried out.'
- The place was flooded with light.
- As Snattman drew closer, Frank crouched for a spring, then leaped directly at the
  smuggler.
- He struck at the man's wrist and the revolver flew out of his grasp.
- It skidded across the landing and clattered down the steps.
- Frank closed in on the man.
- Snattman had been taken completely by surprise.
- Before he could defend himself, Frank forced him against the wall.
- Joe, in the meantime, with a swift uppercut had kayoed one of the other men.
- And Mr. Hardy, whose strength had partially returned, was battling the third as
  best he could.
- But at this moment the boys saw their father's adversary dodge to the wall and press
  a button.
- In an instant an alarm bell sounded in the corridor.
- Within seconds a new group of Snattman's gang appeared.
- As some held drawn revolvers, others overpowered the three Hardys.
- He turned to his men.
- '"Just in time," he gloated, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction.'
- '"If we hadn''t come here when we did, they''d have all escaped!"'
- The Hardy boys were silent, sick with despair.
- '"What are we goin'' to do with these guys?"'
- The voice sounded familiar to the boys and they looked up.
- '"Do with them?"'
- Snattman mused.
- '"That''s a problem.'
- We've got three on our hands now instead of one.
- Best thing is to leave them all here and lock the door."
- '"And put gags in their traps," suggested a burly companion.'
- Red objected.
- '"As long as the Hardys are around here, they''re dangerous.'
- They almost got away this time."
- '"Well, what do you suggest?"'
- '"We ought to do what I wanted to do with the old man in the first place," Red declared
  doggedly.'
- '"You mean get rid of them?"'
- Snattman asked thoughtfully.
- All of them!"
- '"Well-" Snattman gazed at Mr. Hardy with a sinister look.'
- '"I should think you have enough on your conscience already, Snattman!"'
- '"I don''t expect you to let me go," he added bitterly.'
- '"But release my boys.'
- They haven't done anything but try to rescue their father.
- You'd do the same thing yourself."
- '"Oh yeah?"'
- Snattman sneered.
- '"Don''t bother yourself about my conscience.'
- Nobody-but nobody ever stands in my way.
- '"As to letting these boys go, what kind of a fool do you take me for?"'
- Snattman shouted.
- '"If you three are such buddies, you ought to enjoy starving together."'
- The smuggler laughed uproariously at what he considered a very funny remark.
- Frank's and Joe's minds were racing with ideas.
- One thing stood out clearly.
- Snattman had said the Hardys almost escaped.
- This meant that no one was guarding the secret entrance!
- '"If we can only hold out a while," they thought, "the Coast Guard will arrive.'
- There'll be nobody to stop them from coming up here."
- Then, suddenly, a shocking possibility occurred to the boys.
- Suppose the Coast Guard could not find the camouflaged door opening from the pond!
- During the conversation four of the smugglers had been whispering among themselves
  in the corridor.
- One of them now stepped into the room and faced Snattman.
- '"I''d like a word with you, chief," he began.'
- '"What is it now?"'
- The smuggler's voice was surly.
- '"It''s about what''s to be done with the Hardys, now that we''ve got ''em," the
  man said hesitantly.'
- '"It''s your business what you do to people who make it tough for you when you''re
  on your own.'
- But not in our gang.
- We're in this for our take out of the smugglin', and we won't stand for too much
  rough stuff."
- '"That''s right!"'
- '"Is that so?"'
- Snattman's upper lip curled.
- '"You guys are gettin'' awful righteous all of a sudden, aren''t you?'
- Look out or I'll dump the lot of you!"
- '"Oh, no, you won''t," replied the first man who had addressed him.'
- '"We''re partners in this deal and we''re goin'' to have our full share of what
  comes in.'
- We ain't riskin' our lives for love, you know."
- '"We''ve got another idea about what to do with these three prisoners," a third
  smuggler spoke up.'
- '"I think it''s a good one."'
- '"What is it?"'
- Snattman asked impatiently.
- '"We''ve been talkin'' about Ali Singh."'
- Frank and Joe started and listened intently.
- '"What about him?"'
- Snattman prodded his assistant.
- '"Turn the prisoners over to him.'
- He's got a friend named Foster who's captain of a boat sailin' to the Far East tonight.
- Put the Hardys on board that ship," the first smuggler urged.
- Snattman looked thoughtful.
- The idea seemed to catch his fancy.
- '"Not bad," he muttered.'
- '"I hadn''t thought of Ali Singh.'
- Yes, he'd take care of them.
- They'd never get back here."
- He smiled grimly.
- '"Seems like he don''t feed passengers if he can get rid of ''em!"'
- '"All the better.'
- We wouldn't be responsible."
- '"Leave them to AH Singh."'
- Red chuckled evilly.
- '"He''ll attend to them."'
- Snattman walked over to the cot and looked down at Mr. Hardy.
- '"It''s too bad your boys had to come barging in here," he said.'
- '"Now the three of you will have to take a little ocean voyage."'
- He laughed.
- '"You''ll never get to the Coast Guard to tell your story."'
- The detective was silent.
- He knew further attempts at persuasion would be useless.
- '"Well," said Snattman, "haven''t you anything to say?"'
- Do as you wish with me.
- But let the boys go."
- '"We''ll stick with you, Dad," said Frank quickly.'
- '"Of course!"'
- Joe added.
- '"You sure will," Snattman declared.'
- '"I''m not going to let one of you have the chance of getting back to Bayport with
  your story."'
- Then he turned suddenly on his heel.
- '"Well, they''re safe enough," he told Red.'
- '"We have that business with Burke to take care of.'
- Come on, men, load Burke's truck.
- If any policemen come along and find it in the lane we'll be done for."
- '"How about them?"'
- '"Shouldn''t they be guarded?"'
- '"They''re tied up tight."'
- Snattman gave a short laugh.
- '"But I guess we''d better leave one guard, anyway.'
- Malloy, you stay here and keep watch."
- This arrangement seemed to satisfy Snattman.
- He was followed by Red and the other smugglers.
- A heavy silence fell over the room after the departure of the men.
- Malloy crouched gloomily on the box, gazing blankly at the floor.
- The butt of a revolver projected from his hip pocket.
- Frank strained against the ropes that bound him to the chair.
- But the smugglers had done their task well.
- He could scarcely budge.
- '"We''ll never get out of this," he told himself ruefully.'
- Joe was usually optimistic but this time his spirits failed him.
- '"We''re in a tough spot," he thought.'
- '"It looks as if we''ll all be on that ship by morning."'
- '"Shut up, you guys!"'
- Malloy growled.
- '"Quit your talking or I''ll make it hot for you!"'
- He tapped his revolver suggestively.
- After that, a melancholy silence fell among the prisoners.
- All were downhearted.
- It looked as if their fate truly were sealed.
- IN DESPAIR the boys glanced over at their father on the cot.
- To their surprise they saw that he was smiling.
- He looked over at the guard.
- Malloy was not watching the prisoners.
- He sat staring at the floor.
- Occasionally his head would fall forward, then he would jerk it back as he struggled
  to keep awake.
- '"Snattman sure made a poor selection when he chose Malloy as guard," the boys thought.'
- Several times the burly man straightened up, stretched his arms, and rubbed his
  eyes.
- But when he settled down again, his head began to nod.
- In the meantime, the boys noticed their father struggling with his bonds.
- To their amazement he did not seem to be so tightly bound as they had thought.
- Both of them tried moving but could not budge an inch.
- The boys exchanged glances, both realizing what had happened.
- '"Dad resorted to an old trick!"'
- Frank told himself, and Joe was silently fuming, "Why didn't we think of it?"
- Mr. Hardy had profited by his previous experience.
- The detective had expanded his chest and flexed his muscles.
- He had also kept his arms as far away from his sides as he could without being noticed.
- In this way, when he relaxed, the ropes did not bind him as securely as his captors
  intended.
- '"Oh, why were Frank and I so dumb!"'
- Joe again chided himself.
- Frank bit his lip in utter disgust at not having remembered the trick.
- '"But then"-he eased his conscience-"Dad didn''t think of it the first time, either."'
- Mr. Hardy had discovered that the rope binding his right wrist to the cot had a
  slight slack in it.
- He began trying to work the rope loose.
- This took a long time and the rough strands rubbed his wrist raw.
- But at last he managed to slide his right hand free.
- Frank almost shouted.
- He glanced at the guard.
- Malloy appeared to be sound asleep.
- '"Hope he''ll stay that way until we can escape," Frank wished fervently.'
- He and Joe watched their father in amazement, as they saw him grope for one of the
  knots.
- The detective fumbled at it for a while.
- It was slow work with only his one hand free.
- He closed his eyes as if sleeping and his sons followed his example.
- But opening their lids a slit, they watched the smuggler carefully.
- The guard grunted.
- '"They''re okay," he mumbled.'
- Once more he tried to stay awake but found it impossible.
- Little by little his head sagged until his chin rested on his chest.
- Deep, regular breathing told the prisoners he was asleep.
- Mr. Hardy now began work again on the knot of the rope that kept his left arm bound
  to the cot.
- In a matter of moments he succeeded in loosening it and the rope fell away from
  his arm.
- This was an easier task.
- The smugglers had merely passed a rope around the cot to hold the prisoner's feet.
- A few minutes' attention was all that was necessary for the boys' father to work
  his way loose.
- '"Now he''ll release us," Joe thought excitedly, "and we can escape from here!"'
- As Fenton Hardy tiptoed toward his sons, the board floor squeaked loudly.
- The guard muttered again, as if dreaming, shook his head, then sat up.
- '"Oh, no!"'
- Frank murmured, fearful of what would happen.
- He saw his father pick up a white rag someone had dropped.
- A look of intense amazement crossed Malloy's face.
- '"Keep quiet!"'
- The two rolled over and over in a desperate, silent struggle.
- The boys, helpless, looked on, their fears mounting.
- Nevertheless, the detective had the advantage of a surprise attack.
- Malloy had had no time to collect his wits.
- Frank and Joe watched the battle in an agony of suspense.
- If only they could join the fight!
- Mr. Hardy still had the advantage, for he could breathe better than his opponent.
- But suddenly Malloy managed to raise himself to his knees.
- He reached for the revolver at his hip.
- '"Look out, Dad!"'
- Frank hissed.
- '"He''s got his gun!"'
- Quick as a flash the detective landed a blow on the guard's jaw.
- Malloy blinked and raised both hands to defend himself as he fell to the ground.
- Mr. Hardy darted forward and pulled the revolver out of the man's side pocket.
- '"No funny business!"'
- Without being told, Malloy raised his hands in the air.
- He sat helplessly on the floor, beaten.
- '"He''s got a knife too, Dad," Joe said quietly.'
- '"Watch that."'
- '"Thanks, Joe," his father replied.'
- Then, motioning with the pistol, he said, "All right.
- Let's have the knife!"
- Frank and Joe wanted to shout with joy, but merely grinned at their father.
- Still watching Malloy, the detective walked slowly backward until he reached Joe's
  side.
- Fortunately, the knife was sharp and the ropes soon were cut.
- '"Boy, that feels good, Dad.'
- Thanks," Joe whispered.
- '"Malloy," Mr. Hardy ordered, "come over here!"'
- He motioned toward the bed and indicated by gestures that the smuggler was to lie
  down on the cot.
- Malloy shook his head vigorously, but was prodded over by Joe.
- The guard lay down on the cot.
- The ropes which had held Mr. Hardy had not been cut.
- The whole procedure had taken scarcely five minutes.
- The Hardys were free!
- '"What now?"'
- Frank asked his father out of earshot of Malloy.
- '"Hide some place until the Coast Guard gets here?"'
- Quickly he told about Tony and Chet going to bring the officers to the smugglers'
  hide-out.
- '"But they should have been here by now," Joe whispered.'
- '"They probably haven''t found the secret door.'
- Let's go down and show them."
- '"They can''t be Coast Guard men," said Mr. Hardy.'
- '"We''ll listen a few seconds, then we''d better run in the other direction.'
- I know the way out to the grounds."
- From below came an ugly, "You double-crosser, you!
- This loot belongs to the whole gang and don't you forget it!"
- '"Listen," said the second voice.'
- '"I don''t have to take orders from you.'
- I thought we was pals.
- Now you don't want to go through with the deal.
- Who's to know if we got ten packages or five from that friend o' Ali Singh's?"
- And the stuff'll be easier to get rid of than those drugs.
- They're too hot for me.
- Snattman can burn for kidnapin' if he wants to-I don't."
- The voices had now become so loud that the Hardys did not dare wait another moment.
- '"Come on!"'
- He led the way back to the corridor and along it to the door at the end.
- Suddenly Frank and Joe noticed him falter and were afraid he was going to faint.
- Joe recalled that his father had had no food except the candy bar.
- Ramming his hands into his pockets, he brought out another bar and some pieces of
  pretzel.
- Quickly he filled both his father's hands with them.
- Mr. Hardy ate them hungrily as his sons supported him under his arms and assisted
  him to the door.
- There's a trap door.
- That's the way Snattman brought me down.
- Got your lights?
- We haven't any time to lose."
- Mr. Hardy seemed stronger already.
- '"I''ll take the lead."'
- He could not budge it.
- '"You try," he urged the boys.'
- '"And hurry!'
- Those men we heard may discover Malloy."
- '"And then things will start popping!"'
- Frank murmured.
- The boys heaved their shoulders against the trap door.
- In a moment there came the rumble of rolling logs.
- The door went up easily.
- Frank peered out.
- No one seemed to be around.
- He stepped up into the shed and the others followed.
- The three stood in silence.
- The night was dark.
- The wind, blowing through the trees, made a moaning sound.
- Before the Hardys rose the gloomy mass of the house on the cliff.
- No lights could be seen.
- From the direction of the lane came dull, thudding sounds.
- Suddenly the Hardys heard voices from the corridor they had just left.
- Quickly Frank closed the trap door and Joe piled up the logs.
- Then, silently, the Hardys stole out into the yard.
- LITHE as Indians the three Hardys hurried across the lawn and disappeared among
  the trees.
- They headed for the road, a good distance away.
- '"I hope a bus comes along," Frank said to himself.'
- An instant later came a hoarse shout.
- The Hardys got away!
- Watch out for them!"
- '"He must be one of the men we heard coming up from the shore," Joe decided.'
- '"They must have found Malloy trussed up!"'
- Instantly the place became alive with smugglers flashing their lights.
- Some of the men ran from the truck toward the road, shouting.
- Others began to comb the woods.
- Another man emerged from the trap door.
- He and his companion dashed to the ocean side of the house.
- Two burly smugglers flung open the kitchen door and ran out.
- One shouted, "They ain't in the house!"
- '"And they''re not down at the shore!"'
- '"I just talked to Klein on the phone down there."'
- '"You guys better not let those Hardys get away!"'
- Snattman's voice cut through the night.
- '"It''ll be the pen for all of you!"'
- '"Fenton Hardy''s got a gun!'
- He took Malloy's!"
- The two men who had gone to the front now returned.
- '"He never misses his mark!"'
- Now they could hear the pounding steps of the smugglers as they dashed among the
  trees.
- The boys' hearts pounded wildly.
- It did not seem possible they could be missed!
- Yet man after man ran within a few yards of the three prone figures and dashed on
  toward the road.
- Presently Mr. Hardy raised his head and looked toward the Pollitt mansion.
- '"Boys," he said tensely, "we''ll make a run for the kitchen door.'
- The men won't expect us to go there."
- The three arose.
- Swiftly and silently they crossed the dark lawn and slipped into the house.
- Apparently no one had seen them.
- '"When Snattman doesn''t find us outdoors," Joe whispered, "won''t he look here
  to make sure?"'
- '"Yes," Mr. Hardy replied.'
- '"But by that time I hope the Coast Guard and State Police will arrive."'
- '"Joe and I found a hidden stairway to the attic," Frank spoke up.'
- '"Snattman won''t think of looking in it.'
- Let's hide up there."
- '"You forget the ghost," Joe reminded his brother.'
- '"He knows we found that stairway."'
- '"Nevertheless, Frank''s suggestion is a good one," Mr. Hardy said.'
- '"Let''s go to the attic.'
- Were any clothes hanging in the closet that might be used to conceal the door?"
- '"Yes, a man''s bathrobe on a rod."'
- Reaching the second floor, Frank looked out the rear window of the hall.
- '"The smugglers are coming back!"'
- '"The lights are heading this way!"'
- Finally the trio reached it.
- '"Scatter and search every room!"'
- Snattman's crisp voice rang out.
- '"We''re trapped!"'
- Joe groaned.
- '"Maybe not," Frank said hopefully.'
- '"I have a hunch Klein was the ghost.'
- It's possible that he's the only one who knows about this stairway and he's down
  at the shore."
- '"We''ll risk going up," Mr. Hardy decided.'
- '"But not a sound."'
- He slid the bathrobe across the rod, so that it would hide the door.
- '"The stairs creak," Joe informed him.'
- '"And lean forward, so you won''t lose your balance," he warned.'
- After closing the door, Joe and his father quickly followed.
- The three moved noiselessly to a spot out of sight of the stairway behind a large
  trunk.
- They sat down and waited, not daring even to whisper.
- From downstairs they could hear running footsteps, banging doors, and loud talk.
- '"Not here!"'
- '"Not here!"'
- '"Not here!"'
- '"This is it!'
- The end!
- They're going to search up here!"
- Frank thought woefully.
- His father reached over and grasped a hand of each of his sons in a reassuring grip.
- Someone yanked open the closet door.
- The Hardys became tense.
- Would the robe over the entrance to the secret stairway fool him?
- The smugglers went downstairs.
- There were fervent handshakes among the detective and his sons.
- Other than this they did not move a muscle of their bodies, although they inwardly
  relaxed.
- Now new worries assailed the Hardys.
- Frank's heart gave a jump.
- He suddenly realized that his father was hiding to protect his sons.
- '"What a swell father he is!"'
- Frank thought.
- Then another idea came to him.
- '"Maybe being here isn''t such a bad plan after all.'
- Dad might have been fatally shot if he'd been anywhere else on the property."
- A moment later the Hardys again became aware of voices on the second floor.
- They recognized one as Snattman's, the other as Klein's.
- '"Yeah, there''s a secret stairway to the attic," Klein announced.'
- '"I found it when I was playin'' ghost.'
- And them Hardy boys-they found it too.
- The Hardys' spirits sank.
- '"Go up and look, Klein," ordered Snattman.'
- '"Not me.'
- Fenton Hardy has Malloy's gun."
- '"I said go up!"'
- '"You can''t make me," Klein objected in a whining tone.'
- '"I''d be a sure target ''cause I couldn''t see him.'
- He'd be hiding and let me have it so quick I'd never know what hit me."
- Give me that big light!"
- Suddenly a brilliant beam was cast into the attic.
- It moved upward, accompanied by heavy footsteps.
- '"Hardy, if you want to live, say sol" Snattman said, an evil ring in his voice.'
- No answer from the detective.
- '"We''ve got you cornered this time!"'
- Mr. Hardy did not reply.
- '"Listen, Hardy!"'
- Snattman shouted.
- '"I know you''re up there because you moved that bathrobe.'
- I'll give you just one minute to come down out of that attic!"
- Still no answer and an interval of silence followed.
- Then came Snattman's voice again.
- '"This is your last chance, Hardy!"'
- Nearly a minute went by without a sign from the two enemy camps.
- Then Snattman moved up the stairs a few more steps.
- '"Hardy, I have a proposition to make to you," he said presently.'
- '"I know you don''t want to die and you want those boys of yours to live too.'
- Well, so do I want to live.
- So let's call it quits."
- The detective maintained his silence and Snattman continued up the steps.
- '"Give you my word I won''t shoot.'
- And I know you never fire first unless you have to."
- A moment later he appeared at the top of the stairs, empty-handed except for the
  light.
- In a moment he spotted the Hardys with his high-powered flashlight.
- '"Here''s the proposition-your lives in exchange for mine and my gang''s."'
- '"How do you mean?"'
- Mr. Hardy asked coldly.
- '"I mean," the smuggler said, "that you are my hostages."'
- Frank and Joe exclaimed together.
- '"But if they do come?"'
- Frank asked.
- '"Then I''ll bargain with them," Snattman answered.'
- '"And I don''t think they''ll turn me down.'
- They don't know where you are, but I'll make them understand I mean business.
- If they take me, you three die!"
- Frank and Joe gasped.
- To their amazement he looked calm, but his mouth was drawn in a tight line.
- '"It won''t do you any good to shoot me, Hardy," the smuggler said.'
- '"Mallory said all the chambers in that gat are empty but one.'
- If the gang hears a shot, they'll be up here in a minute to finish you all off properly."
- He now started backing toward the stairway.
- '"I think I''m a pretty fair guy," he said with the trace of a satisfied smile.'
- '"And one to be hated and feared!"'
- Joe thought in a rage.
- '"We''ve got to outwit this man somehow!"'
- But at the moment the possibility of this looked hopeless.
- Then suddenly Tony exclaimed, "Oh, oh!
- My starboard light just went out."
- Chet turned to look at the portside.
- '"This light''s all right.'
- Must be the bulb in the other one."
- '"That''s what I was afraid of," said Tony.'
- '"I''ll bet I haven''t another bulb."'
- '"You mean, somebody might not see the Napoli and ram us?"'
- Chet asked fearfully.
- '"We''ll have to be careful," Tony replied.'
- '"Chet, take the wheel, will you?'
- I'll see if I can find an extra bulb."
- Chet changed places with Tony, throttled the motor, and gazed intently ahead.
- The moon had not yet risen and it was difficult to see very far ahead.
- '"Find anything?"'
- Chet called out, as Tony finished his round of the lockers and was now rummaging
  in the last one.
- '"Not yet."'
- Tony pulled out a canvas bag, a pair of sneakers, and some fishing tackle.
- As he reached in for the last article in the locker, he gave a whoop of joy.
- '"Here''s one bulb-just one-keep your fingers crossed, pal.'
- If this isn't any good, we're in a mess."
- '"And breaking the law besides," Chet added.'
- He held his breath as Tony went forward and crawled inside the prow of the Napoli.
- With a flashlight, Tony found the protecting shield for the bulb and unfastened
  it.
- After removing the dead bulb, he screwed in the new one.
- As the light flashed on, Tony breathed a sigh of relief and started to crawl out
  of the prow.
- '"Good work!"'
- Chet said.
- '"It''s lucky we-" Chet never finished the sentence.'
- At this instant he saw another speedboat loom up in front of him.
- Like lightning he swung the wheel around, missing the oncoming craft by inches!
- '"You fool!"'
- '"Why don''t you look where you''re going?"'
- Chet did not reply.
- He was quivering.
- '"Oh, now I''ve done it!"'
- There was no response from Tony for several seconds.
- He had been thrown violently against the side of the boat and was dazed.
- But he quickly collected his wits and crawled down beside Chet.
- '"What happened?"'
- Chet told him, then said, "You'd better take over.
- I'm a rotten pilot."
- Tony took the seat behind the wheel, started the motor, and sped off toward Barmet
  Bay.
- '"We''ve sure wasted a lot of time," he remarked.'
- '"I wonder how Frank and Joe are making out."'
- '"Hope they found Mr. Hardy," Chet added.'
- There was no more conversation until the boys turned into the bay.
- He pulled up at the dock, where two patrol boats and a cutter were tied.
- The two boys climbed out and hurried up to the white building.
- Jerry Gilroy, another Bayport High friend, was with them.
- '"Well, for Pete''s sake!"'
- Where are Frank and Joe?"
- '"Still hunting for the smugglers," Chet replied.'
- '"What brings you here?"'
- She confessed to being exceedingly worried about her sons.
- '"I told her I''d round up a couple of the fellows and go on a hunt," Biff went
  on.'
- '"Jerry thought maybe Frank and Joe had come back to town and were somewhere around.'
- They're going to send out boats.
- You'd better come in and talk to Chief Warrant Officer Robinson yourself."
- The boys hurried inside.
- '"Can you send help out there right away?"'
- Chet asked.
- '"We''ll show you where the secret tunnel is."'
- '"This is astounding," said Chief Robinson.'
- '"I''ll order the Alice out.'
- You can start within five minutes."
- '"I''ll phone Mrs. Hardy right away," Jerry offered.'
- '"I''m afraid, though, that the news isn''t going to make her feel too good."'
- Chet revealed the Hardy suspicions about Snattman being one and Ali Singh the other.
- Robinson raised his eyebrows.
- '"Those Hardy boys certainly take after their father," he remarked.'
- '"They have the makings of good detectives."'
- '"Frank and Joe are sure there is some connection between the house and the smugglers."'
- '"And they are probably right," the chief remarked.'
- '"I''ll call the State Police at once and tell them the latest developments in this
  case."'
- The boys waited while he made the report.
- The connection was made and the boys listened with great interest to the conversation.
- The captain had a booming voice which they could hear plainly.
- '"Yes, I have a sailor named AH Singh," he replied in answer to Chief Robinson''s
  question.'
- '"He''s a member of the kitchen crew."'
- The drugs could be in an inflated waterproof bag."
- Chief Robinson requested.
- How far offshore are you?"
- '"About sixteen miles from your headquarters," was the answer.'
- '"Will you keep in touch with the patrol boat?"'
- Robinson requested.
- '"It''s the Henley, in charge of Chief Petty Officer Brown."'
- '"I''ll do that."'
- '"Ali Singh can be arrested when your ship docks."'
- As the conversation was concluded, a uniformed coastguardman came in.
- '"I''m ready, sir," he told his chief, after a short briefing.'
- He turned to the boys.
- '"All set?"'
- Chet and Tony nodded.
- As they turned to follow Bertram, Biff, Phil, and Jerry looked glum.
- How would you like to go on the Henley with Chief Petty Officer Brown and watch
  the fun?"
- The eyes of the three boys lighted up and Phil said, "You mean it?"
- '"Do you want a formal invitation?"'
- Chief Robinson asked with a laugh.
- '"I understand, sir," Brown replied.'
- '"We''ll leave at once."'
- The three boys followed him down to the dock and went aboard.
- They met the other Coast Guard men and the fast patrol boat set off.
- It seemed to the boys as if the sixteen miles were covered in an incredibly short
  time.
- The lights of the Marco Polo loomed up in the distance.
- '"She''s moving very slowly, isn''t she?"'
- Biff asked their skipper.
- '"Yes, she''s making only about four knots."'
- '"So it would be easy for a small boat to come alongside and take something from
  her?"'
- Phil suggested.
- '"Yes, it would."'
- Quickly the officer picked up a telescope and trained it on the large craft.
- '"The galley hatches are on the left and the tide is coming in," he reported.'
- '"Anything thrown overboard will float toward shore."'
- Suddenly Petty Officer Brown saw one of the hatches open.
- He looked out, then raised a large pail and dumped its contents into the water.
- Quickly he closed the hatch.
- '"Ali Singh!"'
- They watched excitedly to see what would happen now.
- Suddenly Biff grabbed Phil's arm and pointed.
- The boys strained their ears for the sound of a small boat.
- It did not come and they were puzzled.
- The tense skipper suddenly handed the binoculars to Phil.
- Without a word the puzzled boy looked through them at the spot where Brown had been
  gazing.
- To his amazement he could make out the dim shape of a speedboat with two figures
  in it.
- Each held an oar and was rowing the small boat away from the Marco Polo as fast
  as possible.
- '"We''ve got the smugglers dead to rights!"'
- Petty Officer Brown whispered to the boys.
- '"Aren''t you going to arrest them?"'
- Phil asked.
- '"Not yet," the officer told him.'
- '"I''m afraid we can''t do it without some shooting.'
- I don't want to scare the passengers on the Marco Polo.
- We'll wait a few minutes."
- Suddenly the engine of the smugglers' speedboat was started.
- Tersely, Brown began issuing orders to his men.
- The motors roared into action.
- The chase was on!
- IN A few minutes the Henley's brilliant searchlight was turned on.
- It picked up the speedboat which was racing toward shore at full power.
- But gradually the Coast Guard boat lessened the distance between them.
- Chief Petty Officer Brown picked up a megaphone and shouted for the fleeing men
  to stop.
- They paid no attention.
- '"We''ll have to show them we mean business," the officer told Biff, Phil, and Jerry.'
- '"We''ll shoot across their bow."'
- He ordered the boys out of the line of fire, in case the smugglers should attempt
  to retaliate.
- The Henley plowed ahead and presently the boys heard a shot whistle through the
  air.
- '"Stop your engine!"'
- Brown commanded.
- A second later he added, "Drop those guns!"
- The three scrambled to his side.
- '"The rare drugs!"'
- Biff thought.
- Biff was over the side in a flash and swimming with strong, long strokes to the
  speedboat.
- He went beyond it and around to the far side.
- In the meantime, Petty Officer Brown had ordered the smugglers to put their hands
  over their heads.
- '"You got nothin'' on us!'
- You ain't got no right to arrest us!"
- He called out, "You've got plenty on these men!
- Here's the evidence!"
- He held up a waterproof bag, tightly sealed.
- It was transparent and the printing on the contents was easily read.
- '"I happen to know that what''s in here is a rare drug," Biff added.'
- '"I heard our doctor mention it just a few days ago."'
- This announcement took the bravado out of the smugglers.
- The two men insisted they were only engaged to pilot the speedboat and deliver the
  drugs.
- '"We know both the answers already," Petty Officer Brown told the smugglers.'
- Biff was hauled aboard, and as he put his clothes back on, the Henley shot through
  the water.
- He whispered to his pals, "We'll see some more excitement, maybe."
- Some time before this, Chet and Tony had reached the area where the secret tunnel
  was.
- Chet cried out.
- A speedboat with two men in it had just entered the choppy, rocky waters in front
  of the tunnel.
- Skipper Bertram of the Alice ordered.
- The man at the wheel obeyed the command and turned off his motor.
- But instead of surrendering, he shouted to his companion, "Dive, Sneffen!"
- Quick as a flash the two smugglers disappeared into the water on the far side of
  their boat.
- 'When they did not reappear, Chet called: "I''ll bet they''re swimming underwater
  to the tunnel.'
- Aren't we going after them?"
- '"We sure are," Petty Officer Bertram replied.'
- '"Tony, can you find the channel which leads to that tunnel?"'
- '"Then we''ll come on board your boat," the chief petty officer stated.'
- One of the enlisted men in the prow of the boat operated a portable searchlight.
- Everyone kept looking for the swimmers, as they went through the tunnel, but did
  not see them.
- When the Napoli reached the pond, the man swung his light around the circular shore
  line.
- '"There they are!"'
- Chet cried out.
- The two smugglers, dripping wet, had just opened the secret door into the cliff.
- They darted through and the door closed behind them.
- To their surprise the door was not locked.
- '"I''ll go first," Bertram announced.'
- '"But be careful!"'
- Chet begged.
- '"There may be a man with a gun on the other side!"'
- The officer ordered everyone to stand back as he pulled the door open.
- He beamed the searchlight inside.
- No one was in sight I "Come on, men!"
- The group quickly went along the route the Hardys had discovered earlier.
- One by one each room was examined but found to be empty.
- They pushed the trap door but it did not open.
- Their light revealed no hidden springs or catches.
- '"The two smugglers that got away from us may have sounded an alarm," Bertram said.'
- '"They probably set something heavy on.'
- '"Then we''ll heave it off!"'
- Chet declared.
- At last it raised a little, then fell back into place.
- '"It isn''t nailed shut from the other side at any rate," Bertram said.'
- '"Give it another shovel" The four beneath it tried once more.'
- Now they all could hear something sliding sideways.
- '"All together now!"'
- Chet said, puffing.
- '"One, two, three!"'
- The heave that followed did the trick.
- A heavy object above toppled with a crash, and the trap door opened.
- As before, Chief Petty Officer Bertram insisted upon being the first one out.
- There was not a sound from the grounds nor the house and not a light in evidence.
- 'He told the others to come up but cautioned: "This may be an ambush.'
- Watch your step and if anything starts to pop, you two boys go back down through
  the trap door."
- Suddenly there was a sound of cars turning into the lane leading to the Pollitt
  place.
- The vehicles' lights were so bright that Bertram said, "I believe it's the police!"
- A few moments later the cars reached the rear of the old house and state troopers
  piled out.
- The two held a whispered conversation.
- From what the boys overheard, they figured that the troopers planned to raid the
  house.
- He held a gun in his right hand, but with his left he gestured for attention.
- '"My name''s Snattman," he announced with a theatrical wave of his hand.'
- '"Before you storm this place, I want to talk to you!'
- I know you've been looking for me and my men a long time.
- But I'm not going to let you take me without some people on your side getting killed
  first!"
- He paused dramatically.
- '"Come to the point, Snattman," Captain Ryder called up to him.'
- He, too, had a gun poised for action should this become necessary.
- Chet and Tony jumped.
- The boys had found their father, only to become captives themselves.
- And now the three were to be used as hostages!
- '"What''s the rest?"'
- Captain Ryder asked acidly.
- '"This: If you''ll let me and my men go, we''ll clear out of here.'
- One will stay behind long enough to tell you where the Hardys are."
- Snattman now set his jaw.
- '"But if you come in and try to take us, it''ll be curtains for the Hardys!"'
- Chet's and Tony's hearts sank.
- What was going to be the result of this nightmarish dilemma?
- The Hardys tiptoed to the foot of the stairway, only to find their fears confirmed.
- '"We''ll try," his father agreed.'
- '"Joe, take that knife I got from Malloy."'
- As Detective Hardy sat on the steps, leaning weakly against the wall, his two sons
  got to work.
- They managed to maneuver the knives through the crack near the knob.
- Finding the top of the heavy crossbars, the boys began to cut and hack noiselessly.
- Frank's knife was already dull and it was not long before Joe's became so.
- This greatly hampered their progress.
- But the thought that their lives were at stake drove them on.
- They would rest for two or three minutes, then continue their efforts.
- Finally Joe finished cutting through one bar and started on the second of the three
  they had found.
- Ten minutes later Frank managed to cut through his.
- '"Now we can take turns," he told his brother.'
- Working this way, with rest periods in between, the boys found the task less arduous.
- '"We''re almost free!"'
- Joe finally said hopefully.
- Just then, the Hardys heard cars coming into the driveway.
- '"Let''s break this door down and take our chances," Frank whispered hoarsely.'
- '"Snattman and his men would certainly shoot us!"'
- At this instant Frank gave a low cry of glee.
- His knife had just hacked through the last wooden bar.
- Turning the knob, he opened the door and the three Hardys stole silently from their
  prison.
- No one else was around.
- The boys and their father looked at one another, telegraphing a common thought.
- They would rush the king of the smugglers and overpower him!
- You may as well give up without any shooting!"
- '"I''ll never give up!"'
- '"The house is surrounded with troopers and Coast Guard men!"'
- '"What do I care?"'
- Snattman shouted, waving his arms out the window.
- '"I got three hostages here, and I''ve got one of the Coast Guard."'
- '"He''s in the house too?"'
- Snattman laughed.
- '"Trying to catch me; eh?'
- Well, I'm not going to answer that question."
- There was silence outside the house.
- This seemed to worry the man.
- He cried out, "It won't do you any good to talk things over!
- Mr. Hardy knocked the man's gun from his hand.
- It flew out the window and thudded to the ground below.
- The boys pinned his arms back and buckled in his knees.
- From below came a whoop of joy.
- '"The Hardys have captured Snattman!"'
- The voice was Chet Morton's.
- '"My men will never let you in here!"'
- He snarled, twisted, and turned in his captors' grip.
- By this time there was terrific confusion inside and outside the Pollitt place.
- State troopers and the Coast Guard men had burst into both the front and rear doors.
- Others guarded the sides of the house to prevent any escape from the windows.
- A few shots were fired, but soon the smuggling gang gave up without fighting further.
- The capture of their leader and the sudden attack had unnerved them.
- The Hardys waited upstairs with their prisoner.
- Stories were quickly exchanged and Mr. Hardy praised Frank's and Joe's chums for
  their efforts.
- All this time Snattman glowered maliciously.
- Immediately the state trooper fastened handcuffs onto the prisoner.
- '"You mean the man who got away from here in the truck?"'
- Officer Ryder asked.
- '"We''ve set up a roadblock for him and expect to capture him any minute."'
- Frank shook his head.
- '"Ali Singh, the crewman on the Marco Polo, has a friend who owns a small cargo
  ship.'
- Right now, it's lying somewhere offshore.
- The king of the smugglers, who had been silent for several minutes, now cried out,
  "You're crazy!
- There's not a word of truth in it!
- There isn't any boat offshore!"
- The others ignored the man.
- As soon as he stopped yelling, Joe took up the story.
- '"I have a hunch you''ll find that your Coast Guard man is a prisoner on that cargo
  ship.'
- The name of the captain is Foster."
- '"You mean our man Ayres is on that ship?"'
- Petty Officer Brown asked unbelievingly.
- '"We don''t know anyone named Ayres," Frank began.'
- He stopped short and looked at his brother.
- They nodded significantly at each other, then Frank asked, "Does Ayres go under
  the name of Jones?"
- '"He might, if he were cornered.'
- You see, he's sort of a counterspy for the Coast Guard.
- He pretended to join the smugglers and we haven't heard from him since Saturday."
- '"I found out about him," Snattman bragged.'
- '"That name Jones didn''t fool us.'
- I saw him make a sneak trip to your patrol boat."
- Frank and Joe decided this was the scene they had seen through the telescope.
- They told about their rescue of "Jones" after a hand grenade had nearly killed him.
- '"We''ll wait here for you," Captain Ryder stated.'
- '"This case seems to be one for both our branches of service.'
- Two kidnapings on land and a theft from the Marco Polo, as well as an undeclared
  vessel offshore."
- While he was gone, the Hardys attempted to question Snattman.
- '"I heard you inherited this house from your uncle, Mr. Pollitt," Frank began.'
- '"That''s right.'
- What's it to you?"
- Frank was unruffled.
- '"I was curious about the tunnel and the stairways and the cave," he said pleasantly.'
- '"Did your uncle build them?"'
- Snattman dropped his sullen attitude.
- '"No, he didn''t," the smuggler answered.'
- '"My uncle found them all by accident.'
- '"I see," said Frank.'
- '"Have you any idea who did build it?"'
- '"Of course the woodshed wasn''t there then," Snattman explained.'
- '"At least not the one that''s here now.'
- The trap door was, though, but there was a tumble-down building over it."
- '"How about the corridor?'
- Was it the same size when your uncle found it?"
- '"Yes," the smuggler answered.'
- '"My uncle figured that was living quarters for the pirates when they weren''t on
  their ship."'
- '"Pretty fascinating story," Tony Prito spoke up.'
- Several seconds of silence followed.
- Snattman's eyes darted from one boy to another.
- You'll find them in a drawer in the kitchen."
- '"Thanks a lot," said Frank.'
- There was another short silence.
- Then the smuggler went on, his head down and his eyes almost closed, "Mr. Hardy,
  I envy you.
- And I-I never thought I'd be making this kind of a confession.
- You know almost everything about what I've been doing.
- I'll tell the whole story later.
- '"I said I envy you, Mr. Hardy.'
- It's because you brought up two such fine boys and they got swell friends.
- Me-I wasn't so lucky.
- My father died when I was little.
- I was pretty headstrong and my mother couldn't manage me.
- I began to make the wrong kind of friends and after that-you know how it is.
- The most he would do was invite my mother and me here once in a while for a short
  visit.
- I hated him because he made my mother work very hard around the house all the time
  we were here.
- It wasn't any vacation for her.
- '"One of the times when I was here my uncle showed me the pirates'' hide-out and
  I never forgot it.'
- I was afraid to try it while my uncle was alive.
- But when I heard he was dead, I thought that was my chance.
- '"You see, I didn''t dare go to claim the property as the rightful heir.'
- But now I'm planning to take it over.
- Of course it won't do me any good, because I know I'll have to do a long stretch
  in the pen.
- I'm sure that the boys who benefit from living here will always be grateful to you."
- The solemn scene was suddenly interrupted by the return of Chief Petty Officer Brown.
- Chet asked suddenly, "How do we get home?"
- Tony grinned.
- '"I guess the Napoli will hold all of us."'
- They climbed into the Napoli and Tony slipped behind the wheel.
- Suddenly Frank spoke up, "Dad, what happened to your car?"
- Mr. Hardy smiled.
- '"It''s in Bayport in a garage.'
- I was being followed, so I shook off the shadowers and took the bus."
- He added ruefully, "But it didn't do me much good.
- Snattman's men attacked me and took me prisoner on the road."
- Without him, Frank and I might never have found Dad."
- '"Who''s that?"'
- Biff asked.
- '"Pretzel Pete!"'
- Joe replied.
- '"That''s right," said Frank.'
- '"All together, fellows!'
- A rousing cheer for Pretzel Pete!"
