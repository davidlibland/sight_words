- Nobody knew where they came from, or who they were.
- And that was all the villagers learned about the newcomers that night.
- They must have some money, for the girl paid for the bread with a dollar bill."
- '"Make them pay for everything they get," growled the baker, who was a hard man.'
- '"The father is nearly dead with drink now, and soon they will be only beggars."'
- This happened sooner than he thought.
- The next day the oldest boy and girl came to ask the bakeshop woman to come over.
- Their father was dead.
- She went over willingly enough, for someone had to go.
- '"Haven''t you any other folks?"'
- '"Hush, Benny," she said anxiously.'
- This made the bakeshop woman suspicious.
- '"What''s the matter with your grandfather?"'
- '"He doesn''t like us," replied the oldest boy reluctantly.'
- '"He didn''t want my father to marry my mother, and if he found us he would treat
  us cruelly."'
- '"Did you ever see him?"'
- '"Jess has.'
- Once she saw him."
- '"Well, did he treat you cruelly?"'
- '"Oh, he didn''t see me," replied Jess.'
- '"He was just passing through our where we used to live and my father pointed him
  out to me."'
- '"Where did you use to live?"'
- But none of the children could be made to tell.
- '"We will get along all right alone, won''t we, Henry?"'
- '"Indeed we will!"'
- The four children went to bed in the kitchen, and gave the visitor the only other
  bed in the house.
- They knew that she did not at once go to bed, but sat by the window in the dark.
- Suddenly they heard her talking to her husband through the open window.
- '"They must go to their grandfather, that''s certain," Jess heard her say.'
- '"Of course," agreed her husband.'
- '"Tomorrow we will make them tell us what his name is."'
- Soon after that Jess and Henry heard her snoring heavily.
- They sat up in the dark.
- '"Mustn''t we surely run away?"'
- '"Take only what we need most.'
- We must be far off before morning, or they will catch us."
- Jess sat still for a moment, thinking, for every motion she made must count.
- '"I will take both loaves of bread," she thought, "and Violet''s little workbag.'
- Henry has his knife.
- And all Father's money is in my pocket."
- She drew it out and counted it in the dark, squinting her eyes in the faint light
  of the moon.
- It amounted to nearly four dollars.
- '"You''ll have to carry Benny until he gets waked up," whispered Jess.'
- '"If we wake him up here, he might cry."'
- She touched Violet as she spoke.
- We're going to run away," she whispered.
- The little girl made no sound.
- She sat up obediently and tried to make out the dim shadow of her sister.
- '"What shall I do?"'
- '"Carry this," said Jess, handing her the workbag and a box of matches.'
- '"All right.'
- Pick him up," she said to Henry.
- Henry bent over the sleeping child and lifted him carefully.
- '"She may wake up before morning, you know," whispered Henry.'
- '"We must do our fastest walking before then.'
- Jess agreed, and they all walked briskly along in the faint moonlight.
- '"How far can you carry Benny?"'
- '"Oh, at least a mile," said Henry confidently, although his arms were beginning
  to ache.'
- Benny was five years old, and he was a fat, healthy boy as well.
- '"I think we could all walk faster if we woke him up," said Jess decidedly.'
- '"We could each take his hand and almost carry him along."'
- Henry knelt by the roadside and set the little fellow against his knee.
- '"Come, Benny, you must wake up now and walk!"'
- '"Go away!"'
- Benny mumbled with his eyes shut, trying to lie down again.
- '"Let me try," Violet offered softly.'
- '"Say, Benny, you know little Cinnamon Bear ran away to find a nice warm bed for
  the winter?'
- Now, you play you're Cinnamon, and Henry and Jess will help you along, and we'll
  find a bed."
- Violet's little plan worked.
- Not a soul passed them on the country road.
- All the houses they saw were dark and still.
- '"I must go to sleep, Henry," murmured Jess at last.'
- Little Benny was asleep already, and Henry was carrying him again.
- '"The first place we come to, then," panted Henry.'
- Violet said nothing, but she kept her eyes open.
- Finally she caught Henry's sleeve.
- '"Couldn''t we make that haystack do?"'
- '"Indeed we could," said Henry thankfully.'
- '"What a big, enormous one it is!'
- I was too sleepy to see it, I guess."
- '"And see how far away from the farmhouse and barn it is, too!"'
- The sight gave them new courage.
- Violet, after a moment of watching her, did the same.
- '"Here''s his nest," said Jess sleepily, taking her head out of the deep round hole
  she had made.'
- '"We can stay here just as long as we like, can''t we, Henry?"'
- '"We sure can," replied Henry.'
- '"You''re an old brick, Jess.'
- Get in, and I'll pull the hay over the hole."
- Just as he did so he heard a heavy voice say, "Now, then, lass, git along!"
- And that will give us time to cover a lot more ground."
- He dropped asleep just as the roosters all over the valley began to answer each
  other.
- In fact, it was nearly seven o'clock in the evening when they awoke.
- Luckily, all the others awoke before Benny.
- '"Can you hear me, Jess?"'
- '"Yes," answered Jess softly.'
- '"Let''s make one big room of our nests."'
- No sooner said than done.
- The boy and girl worked quickly and quietly until they could see each other.
- They pressed the hay back firmly until they had made their way into Violet's little
  room.
- And then she in turn groped until she found Benny.
- '"Hello, little Cinnamon!"'
- And Benny at once made up his mind to laugh instead of cry.
- '"You''re old enough now, Benny, to understand what I say to you.'
- Now, listen!
- If you don't mind, you will be in danger.
- Do you understand?"
- '"Don''t I have to mind Jess and Violet too?"'
- '"You have to mind us all, every one of us!"'
- Benny thought a minute.
- '"Can''t I ask for what I want any more?"'
- '"Indeed you can!"'
- '"What is it you want?"'
- '"I''m awful hungry," said Benny anxiously.'
- Henry's brow cleared.
- '"Good old Benny," he said.'
- '"We''re just going to have supperor is it breakfast?"'
- Jess drew out the fragrant loaf of bread.
- '"That''s because we have to be the strongest, and crusts make you strong," explained
  Jess.'
- Violet looked at her older sister.
- She thought she knew why Jess took the crust, but she did not speak.
- '"We will stay here till dark, and then we''ll go on with our journey," said Henry
  cheerfully.'
- '"I want a drink," announced Benny.'
- '"A drink you shall have," Henry promised, "but you''ll have to wait till it''s
  really dark.'
- He was much refreshed from his long sleep, and felt very lively.
- Violet had all she could do to keep him amused, even with Cinnamon Bear and his
  five brothers.
- At last Henry peeped out.
- It was after nine o'clock.
- There were lights in the farmhouse still, but they were all upstairs.
- '"We can at least get a drink now," he said.'
- And the children crept quietly to the noisy little brook not far from the haystack.
- '"Cup," said Benny.'
- '"No, you''ll have to lie down and drink with your mouth," Jess explained.'
- And so they did.
- Never did water taste so cool and delicious as it did that night to the thirsty
  children.
- '"If we meet any one," said Jess, "we must all crouch behind bushes until he has
  gone by."'
- They walked along in the darkness with light hearts.
- They were no longer tired or hungry.
- Their one thought was to get away from their grandfather, if possible.
- '"If we can find a big town," said Violet, "won''t it be better to stay in than
  a little town?"'
- '"You''ve got brains, Violet!"'
- He had hardly said this, when a wagon was heard behind them in the distance.
- It was coming from Middlesex.
- Without a word, the four children sank down behind the bushes like frightened rabbits.
- They could plainly hear their hearts beat.
- The horse trotted nearer, and then began to walk up the hill.
- '"If we hear nothing in Townsend," they heard a man say, "we have plainly done our
  duty."'
- It was the baker's voice!
- There was silence as the horse pulled the creaky wagon.
- '"At least we will go on to Townsend tonight," continued the baker, "and tell them
  to watch out.'
- We need not go to Intervale, for they never could walk so far."
- '"We are well rid of them, I should say," replied his wife.'
- '"They may not have come this way.'
- The milkman did not see them, did he?"
- The baker's reply was lost, for the horse had reached the hilltop, where he broke
  into a canter.
- It was some minutes before the children dared to creep out of the bushes again.
- '"One thing is sure," said Henry, when he got his breath.'
- '"We will not go to Townsend."'
- '"And we will go to Intervale," said Jess.'
- With a definite goal in mind at last, the children set out again with a better spirit.
- And then they came upon a fork in the road with a white signpost shining in the
  moonlight.
- '"Townsend, four miles; Intervale, six miles," read Henry aloud.'
- '"Any one feel able to walk six more miles?"'
- He grinned.
- No one had the least idea how far they had already walked.
- '"We''ll go that way at least," said Jess finally.'
- '"That we will," agreed Henry, picking up his brother for a change, and carrying
  him "pig-back."'
- Violet went ahead.
- The new road was a pleasant woody one, with grass growing in the middle.
- The children could not see the grass, but they could feel it as they walked.
- '"Not many people pass this way, I guess," remarked Violet.'
- Just then she caught her toe in something and almost fell, but Jess caught her.
- The two girls stooped down to examine the obstruction.
- '"What did you say?"'
- '"It must have fallen off somebody''s load," said Jess.'
- '"We''ll take it with us," Henry decided wisely.'
- '"Load on all you can carry, Jess."'
- '"For Benny," thought Violet to herself.'
- '"Oh, dear!"'
- '"What''s the matter?"'
- '"Isn''t the woods a good place to sleep?'
- We can't sleep in the road, you know."
- '"It does seem nice and far away from people," admitted Jess, "and it''s almost
  morning."'
- As they stood still at the entrance to the woods, they heard the rumble of a train.
- '"Never mind the train, either," remarked Henry.'
- '"It isn''t so awfully near; and even if it were, it couldn''t see us."'
- He set his brother down and peered into the woods.
- It was very warm.
- '"More water!"'
- Benny cried, catching his big brother by the hand.
- '"It is only another brook," said Henry with a thankful heart.'
- '"He wants a drink."'
- The trickle of water sounded very pleasant to all the children as they lay down
  once more to drink.
- Benny was too sleepy to eat.
- Jess quickly found a dry spot thick with moss between two stones.
- Upon this moss the three older children spread the hay in the shape of an oval bed.
- '"Pine needles up here, Jess," called Henry from the slope.'
- '"I only hope we won''t have a thunderstorm," said Jess to herself, as she shut
  her tired eyes.'
- SHELTER When Jess opened her eyes it must have been about ten o'clock in the morning.
- She sat up and looked all around her.
- She could see dimly the opening where they had come into the woods.
- She looked around to see that her family was still safely by her.
- Then she looked up at the sky.
- '"Whatever, whatever shall we do now?"'
- She got up and looked in every direction for shelter.
- She even walked quite a little way into the woods, and down a hill.
- And there she stood, not knowing what to do next.
- '"I shall have to wake Henry up," she said at last.'
- '"Only how I hate to!"'
- As she spoke she glanced into the forest, and her feet felt as if they were nailed
  to the ground.
- She could not stir.
- Faintly outlined among the trees, Jess saw an old freight or box car.
- Her first thought was one of fear; her second, hope for shelter.
- As she thought of shelter, her feet moved, and she stumbled toward it.
- It really was a freight car.
- She felt of it.
- It stood on rusty broken rails which were nearly covered with dead leaves.
- Then the thunder cracked overhead.
- Jess came to her usual senses and started back for Henry, flying like the wind.
- He was awake, looking anxiously overhead.
- He had not noticed that Jess was missing.
- '"I''ve found a place!'
- Henry did not stop to ask questions.
- He picked up Benny, telling Violet to gather up the hay.
- '"It''s beginning to sprinkle!"'
- '"We''ll get there, all right," Jess shouted back.'
- '"It''s not far.'
- Be all ready to help me open the door when we get there!"
- As it was, Jess sprang on the stump and Henry, pausing to lay Benny down, did likewise.
- Together they rolled back the heavy door about a foot.
- '"That''s enough," panted Jess.'
- '"I''ll get in, and you hand Benny up to me."'
- '"No," said Henry quietly.'
- '"I must see first if any one is in there."'
- '"It will rain!"'
- '"Nothing will hurt me."'
- '"All''s well!"'
- '"Come in, everybody!"'
- Violet passed the hay up to her brother, and crawled in herself.
- But at that very instant it broke with a vengeance.
- It seemed to the children that the sky would split, so sharp were the cracks of
  thunder.
- But not a drop of rain reached them in their roomy retreat.
- Through it all, Benny slept on.
- Presently the thunder grew fainter, and rumbled away down the valley, and the rain
  spent itself.
- Only the drip from the trees on the top of the car could be heard.
- Then Henry ventured to open the door.
- He knelt on his hands and knees and thrust his head out.
- The warm sunlight was filtering through the trees, making golden pools of light
  here and there.
- In an instant Jess and Violet were looking over Henry's shoulder at the pretty sight.
- '"How different everything looks with the sun shining!"'
- '"Things will soon be dry at this rate."'
- '"It must be about noon," observed Henry, looking at the sun.'
- And as he spoke the faint echo of mill bells in the distance was heard.
- '"Let''s live here!"'
- '"Live here?"'
- Why not?"
- '"Nobody uses this car, and it''s dry and warm.'
- We're quite far away.
- And yet we are near enough to a town so we can buy things."
- '"And we''re near water," added Violet.'
- Jess hugged her sister.
- '"So we are, little mouse," she said"the most important thing of all."'
- '"But" began Henry.'
- '"Please, Henry," said Jess excitedly.'
- '"Unless I can have my dinner," Benny finished anxiously.'
- '"We''ll have something to eat right away, old fellow," said Henry, thankful it
  was no worse.'
- For he himself was beginning to see what a cozy home the car really would make.
- Jess cut the last loaf of bread into four pieces, but alas!
- '"He ought to have milk," said Jess quietly to Henry.'
- '"He shall have milk," replied Henry.'
- '"I''ll go down the railroad track to the town and get some."'
- Jess counted out a dollar in ten dimes and handed it to Henry.
- '"By the time our four dollars are gone, you will have some work to do," she said.'
- All the same Henry did not like to begin his trip.
- '"How I hate to leave you alone, Jess!"'
- '"Oh, don''t you worry," began Jess lightly.'
- '"We''ll have a surprise for you when you come back.'
- You just wait and see!"
- And she nodded her head wisely as Henry walked slowly off through the woods.
- The moment he was out of sight she turned to Benny and Violet.
- '"Now, children," she said, "what do you think we''re going to do?'
- Do you know what I saw over in the sunny part of the woods?
- I saw some blueberries!"
- '"Oh, oh!"'
- '"Can''t we have some blueberries and milk?"'
- '"We certainly" began Jess.'
- But the sentence never was finished, for a sharp crackle of dry leaves was heard.
- Something was moving in the woods.
- A NEW HOME "Keep still!"
- Benny obeyed.
- The three children were as motionless as stone images, huddled inside the freight
  car.
- Jess opened her mouth in order to breathe at all, her heart was thumping so wildly.
- She watched like a cat through the open door, in the direction of the rustling noise.
- And in a moment the trembling bushes parted, and out crawled a dog.
- He was an Airedale and was pulling himself along on three legs, whimpering softly.
- Jess drew a long breath of relief, and said to the children, "It's all right.
- Only a dog.
- But he seems to be hurt."
- At the sound of her voice the dog lifted his eyes and wagged his tail feebly.
- He held up his front foot.
- '"Poor doggie," murmured Jess soothingly, as she clambered out of the car.'
- '"Let Jess see your poor lame foot."'
- But this dog's tail was wagging, certainly, so Jess bent over without fear to look
  at the paw.
- '"I guess I can fix that," said Jess briskly.'
- '"But taking the thorn out is going to hurt you, old fellow."'
- The dog looked up at her as she laid his paw down, and licked her hand.
- '"Come here, Violet and Benny," directed Jess.'
- She took the animal gently in her lap and turned him on his side.
- The dog snapped it up as if he were nearly starved.
- The dog did not utter a sound.
- He lay motionless in her lap, until the thorn suddenly let go and lay in Jess' hand.
- '"Good, good!"'
- '"Wet my handkerchief," Jess ordered briskly.'
- Violet did so, dipping it in the running brook.
- '"We''ll s''prise Henry, won''t we?"'
- '"Now we got a dog!"'
- '"To be sure," said Jess, struck with the thought, "but that isn''t what I intended
  for a surprise.'
- '"Of course you can, Pet!"'
- '"Look over there by those rocks."'
- Benny and Violet scrambled through the underbrush to the place Jess pointed out,
  and investigated.
- '"O Jessy," screamed Benny, "you never saw so many in your life!'
- What'll we pick 'em into?"
- '"But that''s just as well," she thought.'
- '"Because he won''t get so hungry waiting for the milk."'
- She watched the two children a moment as they dropped handfuls of the bluish globes
  on the towel.
- '"Oh, dear," sighed Jess.'
- '"I wish I could hunt for some dishes, so we could have blueberries and milk."'
- '"Never mind tonight," said Violet.'
- '"We can just eat a handful of berries and then take a drink of milk, when Henry
  comes."'
- But you should have seen Henry stare when he saw what Jess was holding!
- '"Where in the world" began the boy.'
- '"He camed to us," volunteered Benny.'
- '"He camed for a s''prise for you.'
- And he's a nice doggie."
- Henry knelt down to look at the visitor, who wagged his tail.
- '"It wouldn''t be a bad thing to have a watchdog," said Henry.'
- '"I worried about you all the time I was gone."'
- '"Did you bring some milk?"'
- '"Bless his heart!"'
- '"We''ll have dinner right awayor is it supper?"'
- '"Call it supper," suggested Henry, "for it''s the last thing we''ll have to eat
  today."'
- '"And then tomorrow we''ll start having three meals every day," laughed Jess.'
- It was certainly a queer meal, whatever it was.
- '"Dogs don''t eat cheese," Benny remarked cheerfully.'
- The poor little fellow was glad of it, too, for he was very hungry.
- '"I''m sorry we haven''t cups," Jess remarked.'
- '"We''ll just have to drink out of the same bottle."'
- '"No, we won''t," said Henry.'
- '"We''ll drink half of each bottle, so that will make at least two things to drink
  out of."'
- '"Good for you, Henry," said Jess, much relieved.'
- '"You and Benny use one, and Violet and I will use the other."'
- So the meal began.
- '"Look, Benny," directed Henry.'
- '"Eat a handful of blueberries, then take a bite of brown bread, then a nibble of
  cheese.'
- Now, a drink of milk!"
- '"It''s good!'
- It's good!"
- '"That''ll be fun, Benny," added Violet.'
- '"We''ll wash our paws in the brook just the way Cinnamon does."'
- '"First, let''s gather armfuls of dry pine needles," ordered Jess.'
- '"Get those on top that have been lying in the sunshine."'
- Soon a pile as high as her head stood just under the freight-car door.
- '"I think we have enough," she said at last.'
- One of the big squares was laid across Benny's hay and tucked under.
- That was the softest bed of all.
- Violet's apron and her own, she cut off at the belt.
- '"I''ll sleep next to Benny," said Henry, "with my head up by the door.'
- Then I can hear what is going on."
- The remainder of the needles Jess piled into the farthest corner of the car for
  herself and Violet.
- '"We''ll all sleep on one side, so we can call it the bedroom."'
- '"What''ll be the other side?"'
- '"The other side?"'
- '"Let me think!'
- I guess that'll be the sitting room, and perhaps some of the time the kitchen."
- '"On rainy days, maybe the dining room," added Henry with a wink.'
- '"Couldn''t it be the parlor?"'
- '"Certainly, the parlor!'
- We forgot that," agreed Jess, returning the wink.
- She was covering the last two soft beds with the two aprons.
- '"The tops of these aprons are washcloths," she said severely.'
- Then armed with the big cake of soap she led the way to the brook.
- The dog watched them anxiously, but when Jess said, "Lie still," he obeyed.
- The clean cool brook was delightful even to Benny.
- When they were well rinsed with clear water they dried themselves with the towel.
- They flapped lazily in the wind.
- '"Looks like home already, Jess," said Henry, smiling at the washing.'
- The tired children clambered into the "bedroom," Jess coming last with the wounded
  dog.
- '"We''ll have to leave the door open, it''s so hot," said Henry, lying down with
  a tired sigh.'
- He sat watching gravely in the door of the car as Jess descended to get breakfast.
- Below that she found a larger basin, lined with gravel, with flat stones surrounding
  it.
- '"This will be the washtub," she decided.'
- '"And now I must go back to the refrigerator."'
- They were now fairly icy to the touch.
- Jess smiled as she drew them out.
- '"Is it good?"'
- There he sat in the door of the car, swinging his legs, his arm around the shaggy
  dog.
- '"It''s delicious!"'
- '"Cold as ice."'
- She climbed up beside him as she spoke, bringing the breakfast with her.
- The other two children sat up and looked at it.
- '"Today, Jess," began Henry, "I will go back to town and try to get a job mowing
  lawns or something.'
- Then we can afford to have something besides milk for breakfast."
- Henry did not waste any time talking.
- '"Glad you''ve got a dog, Jess," he called back, as he waved his straw hat.'
- The children watched him disappear around the curve and then turned to Jess expectantly.
- They were not mistaken.
- Jess had a plan.
- '"We''ll explore," she began mysteriously.'
- '"We''ll begin here at the car, and hunt all over these woods until we find a dump!"'
- '"What''s a dump?"'
- '"O Benny!"'
- '"You know what a dump is.'
- All old bottles and papers and broken dishes."
- '"And wheels?"'
- '"Will there be any old wheels?"'
- '"Yes, maybe," assented Violet.'
- '"But cups, Benny!'
- Think of drinking milk out of a cup again!"
- '"Oh, yes," said Benny, politely.'
- But it was clear that his mind was centered on wheels rather than cups.
- The fourth paw, nicely bandaged with Jess' handkerchief, he held up out of harm's
  way.
- '"I think this is a spur track," said Jess.'
- This explanation seemed very likely, for here and there were stumps of trees and
  decaying chips.
- Violet took note of these chips, and remembered them some days later.
- In fact, both girls kept their eyes open, and pointed out things of interest to
  each other.
- '"Remember these logs, Violet, if we should ever need any," said Jess pointing.'
- '"Blackberry blossoms!"'
- '"Big flat stones!"'
- And here from the top of the wooded hill the children could plainly see the city
  in the valley.
- '"There''s a wheel!"'
- Benny cried triumphantly from behind.
- It was a royal dump, containing both cups and wheels.
- '"O Benny!"'
- She hugged him, wheel and all, and began turning over the rubbish with great delight.
- '"Here''s a big white cup," said Jess delightedly, laying it aside.'
- '"Want a teapot, Jessy?"'
- '"Yes, indeed!"'
- '"We can use that for water.'
- I've found two cups and a bowl already.
- And Violet, we ought to be looking for spoons, too."
- Violet pointed without speaking to her little pile of treasures.
- There were five iron spoons covered with rust.
- To please him, Jess allowed him to add them to the growing pile.
- '"Here''s a big iron kettle," observed Violet.'
- '"But we won''t really cook with a fire, will we, Jess?"'
- '"We''ll take it back, though," replied Jess with a knowing look.'
- '"We can pile lots of dishes in it."'
- They could, and did, but not until after Benny had discovered his beloved "pink
  cup."
- It had a perfectly good handle, gold into the bargain.
- Its only flaw was a dangerous crack through the lamb's nose and front feet.
- Jess made a cushion for it out of grass and laid it on top of the kettle full of
  treasures.
- Children do not usually care for dishwashing.
- But never did a little boy hand dishes to his sister so carefully as Benny did.
- Jess scoured the rust from the spoons with sand.
- The children sat back and looked admiringly at their own handiwork.
- But they did not look long.
- There was too much to be done.
- '"Jess," exclaimed Violet, "I''ll tell you!"'
- Violet seldom spoke so excitedly.
- Even Benny turned around and looked at her.
- '"Come and see what I noticed inside the car last night!"'
- Both children followed her, and peered in at the door.
- '"See, on the wall, right over on the other door, Jess."'
- But she whirled around and around as fast as she could, clapping her hands.
- It was a perfect shelf.
- The children could hardly wait to arrange the shining new dishes on the shelf.
- This she put in the middle, with the broken edge hidden.
- '"You said ''there'' three times, Jessy," remarked Benny, contentedly.'
- '"So I did," replied Jess laughing, "but I''m going to say it again."'
- She pointed and said, "There!"
- Henry was coming up the path.
- EARNING A LIVING Henry had all sorts of packages under his arm and in his pockets.
- But he wouldn't open them or tell a thing about his adventures until dinner was
  ready, he said.
- '"Jess, you''re a wonder!"'
- At last the tablecloth was spread and Henry unwrapped his parcels before the whole
  excited family.
- It's kept by a little old man, and it's called a Delicatessen Shop.
- He has everything in his store to eat.
- I bought some dried beef because we can eat it in our fingers.
- And I bought a big bone for the dog."
- '"His name is Watch," Jess interrupted.'
- '"All right," said Henry, accepting the name.'
- '"I bought a bone for Watch."'
- Watch fell on the bone as if he were famished, which indeed he nearly was.
- And then when they ate it with spoons!
- Nobody was able to speak a word for several minutes.
- Then Henry began slowly to tell his tale.
- '"I earned a dollar just this morning," he began proudly.'
- '"I walked along the first shady street I came tonice houses, you know.'
- And there was a fellow out mowing his own lawn.
- He's a nice fellow, too, I can tell youa young doctor."
- Henry paused to chew blissfully.
- '"He was pretty hot," Henry went on.'
- '"And just as I came to the gate, his telephone rang.'
- I heard it, and called after him and asked if he didn't want me to finish up."
- '"And he said he did!"'
- He said, 'For goodness' sake, yes!'"
- Henry answered smiling.
- '"You see, he wasn''t used to it.'
- So I mowed the lawn and trimmed the edges, and he said he never had a boy trim it
  as well as I did.
- And then he asked me if I wanted a steady job."
- '"O Henry!"'
- Henry gave his cup a last polish with his spoon and set it down dreamily.
- '"It''s a pretty house," he went on, "and there''s a big garden behind itvegetable
  garden.'
- And an orchard behind thatcherry orchard.
- You ought to see the cherry trees!
- Well, when I was trimming the edges near the kitchen door, the cook came and watched
  me.
- She's a fat Irishwoman."
- Henry laughed at the recollection.
- '"She asked me if I liked cookies.'
- Oh, if you had smelled them baking you'd have died laughing, Benny.
- So I said I did, and she passed me out one, and when she went back I put it in my
  pocket."
- '"Did she see you?"'
- '"Oh, no," said Henry confidently.'
- '"For I carefully chewed away for a long time on nothing at all."'
- Benny began to look fixedly at Henry's pocket.
- It certainly was still rather bulgy.
- '"When I went, the doctor paid me a dollar, and the cook gave me this bag."'
- Henry grinned as he tossed the paper bag to Jess.
- Inside were twelve ginger cookies with scalloped edges, smelling faintly of cinnamon
  and sugar.
- '"How are you going to write without a pencil?"'
- '"There are pieces of tailor''s chalk in my workbag," said Violet.'
- It was never erased, and Henry often now looks at the account with great affection.
- Soon the girls came to inspect it.
- '"Earned, $1.00; Cash on hand, $3.85," read Jess aloud.'
- '"What on earth?"'
- Henry laughed a little, and watched her face as he drew out his last package and
  handed it to her.
- '"I thought we ought to have a tablecloth," he explained.'
- '"So I got a yard at the ten-cent storebut it isn''t hemmed, of course."'
- With a cry of delight Violet unwrapped the brown cloth with its edge of blue.
- Her clever fingers were already evening the two ends.
- She was never so happy as when with a needle.
- Henry set off again with a light heart.
- And here was Benny, curled up sound asleep on the ground with the dog for a pillow.
- It was quite late when Henry returned.
- In fact, it was nearly seven o'clock, although he didn't know that.
- Several treasures had been added in his absence.
- The broom stood proudly in the corner with a slim stick for a handle.
- The new tablecloth had been washed and was drying on the line.
- And Jess, who had decided to wash one garment a day, had begun with Benny's stockings.
- When Henry came they were being put on again with much pride by Benny himself.
- Violet had darned a big hole in each.
- This time Henry himself could not wait to tell his sisters what he had.
- He passed them the package at once, with shining eyes.
- It was butter, cool and sweet.
- '"These are trick spoons," explained Henry.'
- '"Turn them upside down, and use the handle, and they become knives."'
- With dried beef, and a cookie for dessert, who could ask for better fare?
- Certainly not the four children, who enjoyed it more than the rarest dainties.
- '"I washed the doctor''s automobile this afternoon," Henry related.'
- '"Then I washed both piazzas with the hose, and tomorrow I''m going to hoe in the
  garden.'
- Oh, wouldn't I love to have a nice cold swim in that brook!"
- Henry was hot and sticky, certainly.
- He looked with longing eyes at the waterfall as he finished the last crumbs of his
  supper.
- '"I wonder if we couldn''t fix up a regular swimming pool," he said, half to himself.'
- '"Of course we could," replied Violet, as if nothing were too difficult.'
- '"Jess and I know where there are big logs, and big flat stones."'
- '"You do, hey?"'
- '"Well, why couldn''t we, Henry?"'
- '"Just a little below this there is a sort of pool already, only not big enough."'
- '"We sure could!"'
- '"Some day I''ll stay home from work, and we''ll see."'
- Nobody realized that Henry had been working only one day in all.
- Henry went to bed that night with a head full of plans for damming up the brook.
- He almost shouted when he thought suddenly of Benny's wheels.
- He began to plan to make a cart to carry the heavy stones to the brook.
- And that was when he first noticed that Watch was not asleep.
- He could see his eyes shining red in the darkness.
- It must have been around eleven o'clock.
- Henry reached over and patted his rough little back.
- Watch licked the hand, but didn't close his eyes.
- Suddenly he began to growl softly.
- Now thoroughly startled, he sat up; Jess sat up.
- They did not hear a sound.
- '"Better shut the door," breathed Henry.'
- Together they rolled the door very slowly and softly until it was shut.
- Still they did not hear anything.
- But still Watch continued his uneasy growling.
- Violet and Benny slumbered on.
- Jess and Henry sat motionless, with their hearts in their mouths.
- '"Supposing it was some other tramp," whispered Jess, "somebody else that wanted
  to sleep here!"'
- '"Watch would bite ''em," whispered Henry briefly.'
- Jess never knew what confidence Henry had in the faithful dog.
- Then a branch cracked sharply outside, and Watch barked out loud.
- Jess smothered the dog instantly in her arms.
- But it had been a bark and it was loud, clear, and unmistakable.
- '"That settles it," thought Henry.'
- '"Whoever it is, knows there''s someone in here."'
- But nothing happened.
- Nothing at all.
- The children sat in perfect silence for at least a half hour, and nothing more was
  heard.
- Watch sniffed a little when Henry finally rolled the door open again.
- But he then turned around three times and lay down beside Jess, apparently satisfied
  at last.
- Taking the dog's conduct as a sure guide, Henry composed himself for sleep.
- '"It must have been a rabbit or something," he said to Jess.'
- The occupants of the freight car slept peacefully until morning.
- AT HOME Jess and Henry had a short committee meeting next morning before the others
  awoke.
- It was agreed that nobody should be allowed to stray off into the woods alone, not
  even the dog.
- '"What for?"'
- '"Shan''t tell, old fellow," teased Henry.'
- '"You just build it, and you''ll see later."'
- He was just in time to meet the doctor coming in from a night call.
- Theresee that?"
- She pulled out a fairly good-sized carrot as she spoke.
- It had to come out, for it was much too near its neighbors.
- Here was a gardener whom she could trust.
- Henry worked steadily in the hot sun, completing row after row of carrots, parsnips,
  and onions.
- '"Oh, throw them away," she said indifferently.'
- '"Toss them over into the orchard, and sometime we''ll burn them when they get dry."'
- '"Do you mind if I take them myself?"'
- '"Oh, no," said Mrs. McAllister cordially.'
- '"Have you chickens?'
- That will be fine."
- Henry was thankful that she went right along without waiting for an answer.
- But in a way he did have chickens, he thought.
- '"You must stop working now," she said.'
- '"Any time you want to do something, there will be a place for you here."'
- He added a few of the miniature parsnips for good measure.
- They looked like dolls' vegetables.
- But he did not look up.
- He was too anxious to get to the little old man's shop and order his meat.
- '"Your building is done," Benny informed his brother.'
- '"I builded lots of it."'
- '"He really did," agreed Violet, leading the way to the sunny open spot a trifle
  behind the house.'
- The "building" was a fireplace.
- With an enormous amount of labor, the children had made quite a hollow at the base
  of a rock.
- This was lined completely with flat stones.
- More flat stones had been set on end to keep out the wind.
- There were chips and bits of crumpled paper, pine cones, and dry twigs.
- Beside the big rock was a woodpile.
- The children had apparently been working like beavers all the morning.
- Jess had found a heavy wire in the dump, and had fastened it between two trees.
- On the wire the kettle swung merrily.
- '"I couldn''t have done it so well myself."'
- And he honestly believed it.
- '"We have dinner at night, here," observed Jess impressively.'
- '"What did you buy?"'
- When this had been dropped into the kettle, Henry lighted the fire.
- It burned frantically, as if it were trying to encourage the stew to do its best.
- Violet laid the tin plate over the top for a cover, and they all stood by to hear
  the first bubble.
- Soon the savory stuff in the kettle began to boil in good earnest.
- Watch sat down gravely near it, and gave an approving sniff at intervals.
- '"Keep it boiling," advised Henry as he departed again.'
- '"When I come home tonight I''ll bring some salt.'
- And for mercy's sake, don't get on fire."
- Violet pointed silently at the big teapot.
- The little girl had filled it with water in case of emergency.
- '"That''s if Benny gets on fire," she explained"or Watch."'
- Henry laughed and went on his way happily enough.
- '"Think you can clean up this garage?"'
- Henry flashed a look around the place, and met the young man's eyes with a smile.
- It did need cleaning rather badly.
- He opened all the chests of drawers to begin with.
- '"My word!"'
- '"Look at my gloves, Mother," he said, wiping his eyes.'
- '"All mated up.'
- They never met each other before, that I remember."
- Mrs. McAllister looked the garage over, and observed the newly labeled drawers.
- Her son opened one of them, and looked at his four hammers.
- '"My tack hammer, Mother," he said, "your tack hammer, and two other hammers!'
- That last one I never expected to see again.
- If you can use it, you may have it, my boy."
- '"Tomorrow''s Sunday," said the doctor.'
- '"Shall I see you on Monday?"'
- '"Oh, yes," replied Henry, who had lost all track of the days.'
- '"The cherries need picking," said his new friend.'
- '"We could use any number of cherry pickers, if they were as careful as you."'
- He gave him an odd look.
- '"Could you?"'
- '"I''ll surely come down."'
- When he reached his freight-car home a delicious savor greeted him.
- The cook stood by and took off the cover and put in the salt.
- It was absolutely the most tantalizing odor that Henry had ever smelled.
- '"A ladle, as sure as I live!"'
- Jess had found a tin cup in the dump, and fastened on a wooden handle with a bit
  of wire.
- A bit of bread in one hand helped the feast along wonderfully.
- The little wanderers ate until they could eat no more.
- '"I have time before dark to make Benny''s cart," observed Henry, biting a crisp,
  sweet carrot.'
- '"With my wheels?"'
- '"Yes, sir, with your wheels," agreed Henry.'
- '"Only, when it''s done, you''ll have to cart stones in it."'
- '"Sure," said Benny with satisfaction.'
- '"Cart stones or anything."'
- '"We''ll need it in making the dam," explained Henry for the benefit of his sisters.'
- '"Tomorrow''s Sunday, so I shan''t work down in the town.'
- Do you think it's all right to build the pool on Sunday, Jess?"
- '"I certainly do," replied Jess with emphasis.'
- '"We''re just building the dam so we can keep clean.'
- I guess if Sunday is your only day off, it'll be all right."
- Henry's conscience was set at rest as he began with great delight to hammer out
  his bent nails.
- He and Benny ran about finding pieces of wood to fasten the wheels on.
- The cart seemed valuable enough to all of them to take into the house for the night.
- '"They almost play a tune," said Violet, as she listened.'
- '"This will be a good day to wash all the stockings," said Jess.'
- '"We''ll all be wading so much in the brook, anyway."'
- It was a hollow about three yards across.
- There were no stones in it at all.
- '"It''s big enough already," remarked Henry at last, "but it hasn''t enough water
  in it."'
- He measured its depth with a stick.
- '"We''ll have to guess at inches," he said.'
- '"I have a little tape measure in my workbag," ventured his sister Violet.'
- Henry flashed a smile at her.
- '"Is there anything you haven''t got in your workbag?"'
- The children measured the wet stick carefully.
- The water was just ten inches deep in the deepest part.
- Henry explained his plan of engineering to his sisters.
- It ought to be three feet deep before we get through."
- '"O Henry!"'
- '"Benny would get drowned."'
- '"How tall do you think he is, anyhow?"'
- They measured the little boy and found him to be forty-two inches tall.
- That settled it; the pool was designed to be three feet in depth.
- '"Let''s get all the logs up here first," suggested Jess.'
- '"Then we can have the fun of laying them across."'
- In fact, Henry decided at this point to let Benny drop them into the water as he
  gathered them.
- '"Splash ''em right in, old fellow," he directed.'
- '"Only keep them in a nice straight line right across this place between these two
  trees.'
- It won't make any difference how wet he gets," he added in an aside to Jess.
- '"We can dry him in the sun."'
- Jess thought a little differently, although she said nothing.
- '"Good time to wash them!"'
- '"Let me wash them," begged Violet.'
- '"You''re more useful building the dam."'
- '"When we finish the dam they will surely be dry," she said.'
- As for Henry, he was only too glad to work without it.
- '"Makes me feel lighter," he declared.'
- But the children did not have any eyes for birds then.
- '"That makes a solid foundation for the logs, you see," explained Henry with pride.'
- '"They won''t be floating off downstream the minute we lay them on."'
- Then at last the time arrived when they were to lay the logs on.
- '"Let''s wedge the first one between these two trees," said Jess, with a happy thought.'
- '"Good work!"'
- '"That''s just what we''ll do."'
- '"We''ll make the logs so thick it can''t get through.'
- We'll lay three logs across, with three logs on top of them, and three more on top
  of that."
- The children set about stubbornly to accomplish this.
- Violet held great sprays of fine underbrush in place until each log was laid.
- Wetter children never were seen.
- But nobody cared.
- They resolutely plugged the ends with more stones, more underbrush, and more logs.
- Each time a leak was discovered, someone dropped a stone over it.
- This it did slowly.
- Finding now no means of exit, the water was quieter.
- It rose steadily up the barricade of logs.
- It widened beautifully.
- Henry could not sit still.
- '"It slopes!"'
- '"See how clear it is!'
- And still!
- See how still it is!"
- And then the water began to overflow the logs.
- It spilled over the top with a delightful curve.
- '"Just like a regular mill dam," said Henry.'
- He held the measuring stick out as far as he could and plunged it into the water.
- It lacked an inch of being three feet deep.
- '"Deep enough," he declared.'
- In fact it looked so deep that Benny could not conceal a slight fear.
- '"That''s the beauty of the slope," observed Jess.'
- '"Benny can wade in just as far as he wants to, and no farther.'
- We all know what the bed of the pool is likeno holes or stones."
- '"I''d rather swim than eat," he said.'
- Luckily for the children, their supply of provisions was the largest of any day
  since their flight.
- The girls lighted the fire and heated up the remainder of the stew and cut the bread.
- The butter, hard and cold in the refrigerator, was taken out, and four portions
  cut from it.
- The two doughnuts made four half rings for dessert.
- The cooks rang the dinner bell.
- This was an ingenious arrangement hung on a low branch.
- It consisted of a piece of bent steel swung on a string.
- Violet hit it sharply with another piece of steel.
- It sounded deeply and musically through the woods, and the boys understood it and
  obeyed at once.
- It was evident the moment they appeared that at least three of the family had been
  swimming.
- Watch shook himself violently at intervals, spattering water drops in all directions.
- Building a dam is wonderful sauce for a dinner.
- '"I think stew is much better the second day," observed Benny, eating hungrily.'
- There remained two more adventures for the eventful day.
- The girls cut their hair.
- Violet's dark curls came off first.
- '"They''re awfully in the way," explained Violet, "and so much trouble when you''re
  working."'
- They were tangled, too, and Jess cut them off evenly by a string, with Violet's
  little scissors.
- The two girls ran to the brook mirror to see how they looked.
- The new haircut was very becoming to both.
- '"I like you better that way," said Henry approvingly.'
- '"Lots more sensible when you''re living in the woods."'
- They were rewarded by two discoveries.
- The other discovery frightened them a little just at first.
- It was a runaway hen.
- '"She had some eggs, too," remarked Benny as if trying to make pleasant conversation.'
- Jess bent over incredulously and saw a rude nest in the moss in which there were
  five eggs.
- '"A runaway hen!"'
- '"She wants to hide her nest and raise chickens."'
- The children had no scruples at all about taking the eggs.
- '"Almost a gift from heaven," said Violet, stroking one of the eggs with a delicate
  finger.'
- '"It wouldn''t be polite to refuse them."'
- Scrambled eggs made a delicious supper for the children.
- The big kettle, empty and clean, was hung over the low fire and butter was dropped
  in.
- Jess watched it anxiously, tipping the kettle slightly in all directions.
- She was amply repaid for her care when she saw her family attack the meal.
- Clearly this was a feast day.
- But when tomorrow came they had more than bread and milk, as you will soon see.
- '"He certainly said he could use more than one," he mused.'
- '"I can''t see any reason, except one, why we shouldn''t all go," said Jess.'
- '"What''s that?"'
- '"True," agreed Henry.'
- '"But supposing we went down the hill and through the streets two by two?'
- And you took Watch?"
- And so they set out.
- They took down the clothesline and closed the car door.
- Everything instantly looked as lonesome as heart could wish.
- Even the merry little brook looked deserted.
- '"The girls can pick cherries as well as I can," said Henry, introducing his sisters.'
- '"Benny ought not to climb very tall trees, but we had to bring him."'
- '"Benny can carry the baskets, perhaps," suggested the doctor, much amused.'
- '"You see, this is a cherry year, and we have to work quickly when we once begin.'
- Perhaps he could fill the small baskets from the big ones."
- It was a "cherry year," certainly.
- The red ones were huge, bursting with juice, and the trees were laden full with
  the luscious fruit.
- Even the air was perfumed.
- It was a pretty sight that the doctor finally turned his back upon when he went
  on his calls.
- Henry, slim, tanned, and graceful, picked rapidly from the tallest ladder in the
  largest tree.
- The two girls in their sensible bloomer suits could climb like cats.
- '"Eat all you want," Dr. McAllister called back.'
- In less than an hour Benny had made five firm friends.
- '"I never had such a cheerful crowd of cherry pickers before," Mrs. McAllister said
  at last.'
- '"I''d much rather stay out here than go into the house where it is cool."'
- '"You can eat right here in the orchard, unless your mother will be worrying about
  you."'
- This remark met with an astounding silence.
- Henry was the first to collect his wits.
- '"No, our mother is dead," he said evenly, without embarrassment.'
- It was the doctor who hastened to change the subject he had introduced.
- '"I smelled something when I came in," he said to Benny.'
- '"What did it smell like?"'
- '"It smelled like cherry slump," replied the doctor with twinkling eyes.'
- '"Cherry what?"'
- '"I think that''s what they call itslump," repeated Dr. McAllister.'
- '"Do you care to try it?"'
- At this moment Mary appeared in the orchard with an enormous tray.
- And at the first sight of her cookery, nobody cared the least what its name was.
- It was steaming in the red juice, with the least suspicion of melted butter over
  the whole.
- '"Do get two more, Mary," begged Mrs. McAllister, laughing.'
- '"It tastes so much better under the cherry trees!"'
- This was another meal that nobody ever forgot.
- Nowadays those two men sometimes meet Henrybut that's another story.
- Anyway, they never will forget that cherry slump made by Irish Mary.
- But the others worked on steadily.
- Mrs. McAllister kept an eye on them from the screened porch without their knowledge.
- '"Just see how those children keep at it," she said to her son.'
- '"There is good stuff in them.'
- I should like to know where they come from."
- Dr. McAllister said nothing.
- He sauntered out into the orchard when he thought they had worked long enough.
- '"You see, you''re better than most pickers, because you''re so cheerful."'
- He noticed that they did not all leave the yard at the same time.
- When the cherry pickers returned to their little home they examined everything carefully.
- Nothing had been disturbed.
- The door was still shut, and the milk and butter stood untouched in the refrigerator.
- That evening, very much later, a young man sat in his study with the evening paper.
- Four children, aged thirteen, twelve, ten and five.
- Somewhere around the region of Middlesex and Townsend.
- $5000 reward for information.
- James Henry Cordyce "Whew!"
- '"James Henry Cordyce!"'
- He sat in perfect silence for a long time, thinking.
- Then he went to bed.
- Of all people!"
- James Henry Cordyce sat in a huge leather chair in his private office.
- He was a man nearly sixty years of age whose dark brown hair was still untouched
  by gray.
- He had rather hard lines around his mouth, but softer ones around his eyes.
- The men attended it in person, and supplied all the money.
- This was Field Day.
- And not only boys, but men also, old and young, and girls of all ages into the bargain.
- The mill had been closed down for the day.
- Everyone attended Field Day.
- Henry was washing the concrete drives at Dr. McAllister's at this moment.
- '"Hop in," commanded the doctor, not stopping his engine.'
- '"You ought to go to see the stunts at the athletic meet.'
- It's Field Day."
- Henry did not wish to delay the doctor, so he "hopped in."
- '"Can''t go myself," said Dr. McAllister.'
- '"I''ll just drop you at the grounds.'
- There's no charge for admittance.
- You just watch all the events and report to me who wins."
- Henry tried to explain to his friend that he ought to be working, but there was
  actually no time.
- Henry had no pencil, but he had an excellent memory.
- He repeated over and over, the name of each winner as it appeared on the huge signboard.
- It was nearly eleven o'clock when the free-for-all running race was announced.
- '"What do they meanfree-for-all?"'
- '"Why, just anybody," explained the boy, curiously.'
- '"Didn''t you ever see one?'
- Didn't you see the one last year?"
- '"No," said Henry.'
- The boy laughed.
- '"That was a funny one," he said.'
- '"There was a college runner in it, and a couple of fat men, and some girlslots
  of people.'
- And the little colored boy over there won it.
- You just ought to have seen that boy run!
- He went so fast you couldn't see his legs.
- Beat the college runner, you know."
- Henry gazed at the winner of last year's race.
- He was smaller than Henry, but apparently older.
- In a few minutes Henry had quietly left his place on the bleachers.
- When the boy turned to speak to him again, he was gone.
- A man stepped up to him quickly.
- '"Want to enter?"'
- '"No time to waste."'
- '"Yes," replied Henry.'
- The man tossed him a pair of white shoes and some blue trunks.
- He liked the look of Henry's face as he paused to ask in an undertone, "Where did
  you train?"
- '"Never trained," replied Henry.'
- '"I suppose you know these fellows have been training all the year?"'
- '"You don''t expect to win?"'
- '"Oh, no!"'
- '"But it''s lots of fun to run, you know."'
- He was dressed and ready by this time.
- How light he felt!
- He felt as if he could almost fly.
- Presently the contestants were all marshalled out to the running track.
- Henry was Number 4.
- '"It''s a mile race," he thought to himself, "and it''s the second half mile that
  counts."'
- In almost no time, Henry was far behind the first half of the runners.
- But strangely enough, he did not seem to mind this greatly.
- '"It''s fun to run, anyhow," he thought.'
- It was fun, certainly.
- He felt as if his limbs were strung together on springs.
- He ran easily, without effort, each step bounding into the next like an elastic.
- After a few minutes of this, Henry had a new thought.
- '"Now you''ve tried how easy you can run, let''s see how fast you can run!"'
- Slowly he gained on the fellow ahead of him, and passed him.
- With the next fellow as a goal, he gradually crept alongside, and passed him with
  a spurt.
- The crowd shouted itself hoarse.
- The field all along the course was black with people.
- Henry could hear them cheering for Number 4, as he pounded by.
- Six runners remained ahead of him.
- Henry could see the finish-flag now in the distance.
- He began to spurt.
- He passed Numbers 14 and 3.
- He passed 25, 6, and 1 almost in a bunch.
- Number 16 remained ahead.
- Then Henry began to think of winning.
- How much the twenty-five dollar prize would mean to Jess and the rest!
- Number 16 must be passed.
- '"I''m going to win this race!"'
- '"I''ll bet you I am!"'
- The thought lent him speed.
- '"Number 4!'
- Number 4!"
- Henry waited until he could have touched him.
- He was within three yards of the wire.
- He bent double, and put all his energy into the last elastic bound.
- He passed Number 16, and shot under the wire.
- Then the crowd went wild.
- It scrambled over and under the fence, cheering and blowing its horns.
- Henry felt himself lifted on many shoulders and carried panting up to the reviewing
  stand.
- Then someone said, "What's your name, boy?"
- Henry felt himself lifted on many shoulders That called him to earth.
- He had to think quickly under cover of getting his breath.
- '"Henry James," he replied.'
- This was perfectly true, as far as it went.
- 'In a moment the enormous signboard flashed out the name: HENRY JAMES No.'
- He knew that was exactly the kind of story that old James Henry would like.
- '"Yes, sir," he said smiling.'
- '"I says to him, ''You don''t expect to win, of course.'''
- And he says to me, 'Oh, no, but it's lots of fun to run, you know.'"
- '"Thank you, sir," returned Mr. Cordyce.'
- '"That''s a good story.'
- Bring the youngster over here, if you don't mind."
- '"I like your spirit, my boy," he said.'
- '"I like your running, too.'
- But it's your spirit that I like best.
- Don't ever lose it."
- '"Thank you," said Henry, shaking hands.'
- When Henry faithfully repeated the list of winners, however, he said nothing about
  it.
- '"What are you going to do with the prize?"'
- '"Put it in the savings bank, I guess," replied Henry.'
- '"Have you an account?"'
- '"No, but Jess says it''s high time we started one."'
- '"Good for Jess," said the doctor absently.'
- He left it in there till he died, and it came to me.
- It amounted to sixteen hundred dollars."
- '"He left it alone for over forty years, you see," explained Dr. McAllister.'
- His family almost forgot to eat while Henry recounted the details of the exciting
  race.
- '"I said my name was Henry James," repeated Henry.'
- '"That''s all right.'
- So it is," affirmed Jess.
- '"It''s clever, too.'
- You can use that name for your bank book."
- '"So I can!"'
- '"I''ll put it in the bank this very afternoon.'
- And by the way, I brought something for dinner tonight."
- Jess looked in the bag.
- There were a dozen smooth, brown potatoes.
- '"I know how to cook those," said Jess, nodding her head wisely.'
- '"You just wait!"'
- '"Can''t wait, hardly," Henry called back as he went to work.'
- When he had gone, Benny frolicked around noisily with the dog.
- '"No school now," said Benny hopefully.'
- '"No, but I can teach you.'
- If I only had a primer!"
- '"Let''s make one," suggested Violet, shaking her hair back.'
- '"We have saved all the wrapping paper off the bundles, you know."'
- Jess was staring off into space, as she always did when she had a bright idea.
- '"Violet," she cried at last, "remember those chips?'
- We could whittle out letters like typemake each letter backwards, you know."
- '"And stamp them on paper!"'
- '"There would be only twenty-six in all.'
- It wouldn't be awfully hard," said Jess.
- '"We wouldn''t bother with capitals."'
- '"What could we use for ink?"'
- Violet wondered, wrinkling her forehead.
- '"Blackberry juice!"'
- The two girls clapped their hands.
- '"Won''t Henry be surprised when he finds that Benny can read?"'
- So he was not much worried about his part of the work.
- '"We''ll teach him two words to begin with," said Jess.'
- '"Then we won''t have to make the whole alphabet at once.'
- Let's begin to teach him see."
- '"That''s easy," agreed Violet.'
- '"So only three pieces of type in all, Violet."'
- As she sat by, crushing the juice from the berries with a stick, Jess planned the
  ink pad.
- '"We''ll have to use a small piece of the wash-cloth, I''m afraid," she said at
  last.'
- But finally they were obliged to cut off only the uneven bits of cloth which hung
  around the edges.
- At last the two words were completed.
- In fact, they were done long before Benny had the slightest idea his sisters were
  ready for him.
- He came willingly enough for his first lesson, but he could not tell the two words
  apart.
- '"Don''t you see, Benny?"'
- Jess explained patiently.
- '"This one with the wiggly s says see?"'
- But Benny did not "see."
- '"I''ll tell you, Jess," said Violet at last.'
- '"Let''s print each word again on a separate card.'
- That's the way they do at school.
- And then let him point to see."
- The girls did this, using squares of stiff brown paper.
- Then they called Benny.
- Then she mixed the cards and said encouragingly, "Now, Benny, point to s-s-s-ee."
- Benny did not move.
- He sat with his finger on his lip.
- Now, this was only an accident.
- Watch did not really know one of the words from the other.
- But Benny thought he did.
- And was he going to let a dog get ahead of him?
- Not Benny!
- In less time than it takes to tell it, Benny had learned both words perfectly.
- '"Good old Watch," said Jess.'
- '"It isn''t really hard at all," said Benny.'
- '"Is it, Watch?"'
- During all this experiment Jess had not forgotten her dinner.
- When you are living outdoors all the time you do not forget things like that.
- In fact both girls had learned to tell the time very accurately by the sun.
- Jess started up a beautiful little fire of cones.
- She had already scrubbed the smooth potatoes and dried them carefully.
- She now poked them one by one into the glowing ashes with a stick from a birch tree.
- Whenever a potato lit up dangerously she gave it a poke into a new position.
- And when Henry found her, she was just rolling the charred balls out onto the flat
  stones.
- '"Burned ''em up?"'
- '"Burned, nothing!"'
- '"You just wait!"'
- '"Can''t wait, hardly," replied Henry smiling.'
- '"You said that a long time ago," said Benny.'
- '"Well, isn''t it true?"'
- '"Come," said Violet breathlessly, forgetting to ring the bell.'
- '"Hold them with leaves," directed Jess, "because they''re terribly hot.'
- Knock them on the side and scoop them out with a spoon and put butter on top."
- '"It''s good," said Benny blissfully.'
- It was about the most successful meal of all, in fact.
- Henry said it was because they were poked with a black-birch stick.
- Benny said it was because Jess nearly burned them up.
- GINSENG What Dr. McAllister ever did before Henry began to work for him would be
  hard to guess.
- There were certainly as many duties always waiting for him as he had time to do.
- And it made no difference to the industrious boy what the job was.
- Nothing was too hard or too dirty for him to attempt.
- One day the doctor set him at the task of clearing out his little laboratory.
- The boy washed bottles, pasted labels, and cleaned instruments for one whole morning.
- '"Can you tell me if this is real ginseng?"'
- Henry heard him say.
- '"It certainly is," returned Dr. McAllister.'
- '"They will give you two dollars a pound for the root at any of the drug stores."'
- Henry ventured to steal a peep, and found he could readily see the plant the man
  was holding.
- It was about a foot high with branching leaves and a fine feathery white flower.
- When the young man had gone, Henry said, "I know where I can find a whole lot of
  that plant."
- '"Is that so?"'
- '"It''s only the root, you know, that is valuable.'
- But any one who wants the bother of digging it up can sell any quantity of that."
- They started out with both knives and two strong iron spoons, and the kettle.
- In fact that first afternoon's work resulted in a kettle full, not counting a single
  leaf or stem.
- That was a great day in the woods.
- There had been one other thing that Benny had given them no peace about.
- Jess, therefore, had plans on foot, the moment she saw Benny's new stockings.
- She washed the old brown stockings with their many neat darns, and hung them up
  to dry.
- And early in the afternoon she and Violet sat with the workbag between them, each
  with a stocking.
- With Benny sitting by to watch proceedings, Jess mapped out a remarkable Teddy-bear.
- Jess worked hard over the head, pushing the padding well into the blunt nose.
- Violet embroidered two beautiful eyes in black and white, and a jet black nose-tip.
- '"You must make a tail, too, Jessy," said Benny, watching her snip the brown rags.'
- '"Bears don''t have tails, Benny," argued Jessalthough she wasn''t exactly sure
  she was right.'
- '"Your old bear didn''t have any tail, you know."'
- And it was true.
- His bear finally did have a tail.
- '"What kind of tail?"'
- '"Bushy, long and slim, or cotton-tail?"'
- '"Long and slim," decided Benny with great satisfaction, "so I can pull it."'
- '"What''s his name, Jessy?"'
- '"His name?"'
- '"Well, you know he''s a new bear; he isn''t your old one, so I wouldn''t call him
  Teddy."'
- '"Oh, no," said Benny, shocked.'
- '"This is not Teddy.'
- This has a pretty tail."
- '"Of course," agreed Jess, trying not to laugh.'
- '"Well, you know we sold that ginseng to pay for your new stockings.'
- And if you hadn't had your new ones, we couldn't have made this bear out of your
  old ones."
- '"You want his name to be Stockings?"'
- No," answered Jess.
- '"I was thinking of ''Ginseng.''"'
- '"That''s a nice name.'
- All right, I think Ginseng will be a good bear, if Watchie doesn't bark at him."
- TROUBLE The days went merrily by for the freight-car family.
- Hardly a day passed, however, without some exciting adventure.
- Each one had a tiny colored rose in the corner, and Violet was delighted with the
  dainty work.
- Benny actually learned to read fairly well.
- Violet kept a different bouquet daily in the little vase.
- One day Jess began to teach Benny a little arithmetic.
- He learned very readily that two and one make three.
- '"I knew that before," he said cheerfully.'
- But it was a different matter when Jess proposed to him that two minus one left
  one.
- '"No, it does not left one," said Benny indignantly.'
- '"It left two."'
- '"Why, Benny!"'
- '"Supposing you had two apples and I took away one, wouldn''t you have one left?"'
- '"You never would," objected Benny with confidence.'
- '"No, but supposing Watch took one," suggested Jess.'
- One day the stranger was allowed to see Violet "Watchie wouldn't take one, neither,"
  said Benny.
- '"Would you, doggie?"'
- Watch opened one eye and wagged his tail.
- Jess looked at Violet in despair.
- '"What shall I do with him?"'
- '"I''ll show you myself," agreed Benny finally with resignation.'
- '"Now see the 2?"'
- He actually made a respectable figure 2 on the freight car.
- '"Now, here''s a nice 1.'
- Now, s'posen I take away the 1, don't you see the 2's left right on the car?"
- He covered the figure 1 with his chubby hand and looked about at his audience expectantly.
- Jess rolled over against a tree trunk and laughed till she nearly cried.
- Violet laughed until she really did cry.
- And here we come to the first unpleasant incident in the story of the runaway children.
- '"How glad I am that it is time for Henry to come!"'
- Henry came promptly at the usual time.
- He thought she had a cold, he said.
- And this seemed likely, for Violet began to cough gently while the rest ate a hasty
  supper.
- '"If she goes there we''ll have to give her name, and then Grandfather will find
  us surely."'
- But about ten o'clock that night Violet had a chill.
- She shivered and shook, and her teeth chattered so that Jess could plainly hear
  them.
- '"I''m going down to Dr. McAllister''s," said Henry quietly.'
- '"I''m afraid Violet is very ill." Nobody ever knew how fast he ran down the hill.'
- Even in his famous race, Henry hardly touched his present speed.
- When the doctor returned he was carrying Violet in his arms.
- Jess and Benny and Watch were following closely.
- Nobody spoke during the drive to the McAllister house as they flew through the darkness.
- The three words were, "Pneumonia, I'm afraid."
- They all heard it.
- A trained nurse in a white dress appeared like magic from nowhere in particular.
- They all worked as best they could to get the sick child warmed up.
- Mrs. McAllister left the sick room then, to attend to the other children.
- Henry and Benny were left in a large spare room with a double bed.
- Jess was put in a little dressing room just out of Mrs. McAllister's own room.
- Upon receiving assurances that Violet was warm again, they went to sleep.
- But Violet was not out of danger, for she soon grew as hot as she had been cold.
- And the doctor never left her side until ten o'clock the next morning.
- Violet, although very ill, did not have pneumonia.
- At about nine o'clock the doctor had a visitor.
- It was a man who said he would wait.
- He did wait in the cool front parlor for over half an hour.
- Then Benny drifted in.
- '"Where is the doctor?"'
- '"He''s nupstairs," answered Benny readily.'
- '"This means a lot of money to him, if he only knew it," said the visitor impatiently.'
- But the man caught him.
- '"What do you mean by that, sonny?"'
- '"What''s he doing?"'
- '"He''s taking care of my sister Violet.'
- She's sick."
- '"And you mean he wouldn''t leave her even if I gave him a lot of money?"'
- '"Yes, that''s it," said Benny politely.'
- '"That''s what I mean."'
- The visitor seemed to restrain his impatience with a great effort.
- '"You see, I''ve lost a little boy somewhere," he said.'
- '"The doctor knows where he is, I think.'
- He would be about as old as you are."
- '"Well, if you don''t find him, you can have me, I shouldn''t wonder," observed
  Benny comfortingly.'
- '"I like you."'
- '"You do?"'
- The gentleman laughed heartily.
- '"No, I guess it''s because you have such a nice, soft laugh," said Benny changing
  his mind.'
- The doctor found him here when he came down at ten o'clock.
- '"Better go and find Watch, Benny," suggested the doctor.'
- '"Perhaps some day I''ll come again," observed Benny to his new friend.'
- '"I like your dog, and I''m sorry he''s dead."'
- With that he scampered off to find Watch, who was very much alive.
- '"I expected you, Mr. Cordyce," said the doctor smiling, "only not quite so soon."'
- '"I came the moment I heard your name hinted at," said James Cordyce.'
- '"My chauffeur heard two workmen say that you knew where my four grandchildren were.'
- That's all I waited to hear.
- Is it true?
- And where are they?"
- '"That was one of them," said the doctor quietly.'
- '"That was one of them!"'
- '"That beautiful little boy?"'
- '"Yes, he is beautiful," assented Dr. McAllister.'
- '"They all are.'
- The only trouble is, they're all frightened to death to think of your finding them."
- '"How do you know that?"'
- '"They''ve changed their name.'
- At least the older boy did.
- In public, too."
- '"What did he change it to?"'
- A flood of recollections passed over the man's face, and he flushed deeply.
- '"That boy!"'
- '"That wonderful running boy?"'
- Then events began to move along rapidly.
- And above all, when Violet is so ill." "Couldn't I see them?"
- '"I could pretend I was a friend of yours, visiting you, who liked children.'
- I would promise not to tell them until you consented."
- '"That might do," said Dr. McAllister.'
- '"If they grew to like you before they knew who you were, it would make things easier,
  certainly."'
- '"Don''t you worry, Mary Bridget Flynn," said Dr. McAllister with emphasis.'
- '"You could cook for the King of England!'
- Just make one of your peach shortcakes for lunch and broil a chicken, and I'll answer
  for him."
- When lunch time came J. H. Cordyce saw all his grandchildren except Violet.
- He smiled with delight when he saw Jess coming down the stairs in her womanly fashion.
- '"Where have I seen that man before?"'
- Henry James, she had added.
- But she had not added the man's name.
- '"She forgot," thought Jess.'
- '"Because she knows him so well, she thinks we do."'
- But although nameless, the stranger caught their attention.
- Henry was interested.
- Benny was fascinated.
- '"I''d like to see the cucumber," said Benny, pausing in the middle of his shortcake.'
- '"Would you, indeed?"'
- '"Some day, if Mrs. McAllister is willing, you and I will ride over to my garden
  and pick it."'
- '"And we''ll bring it to Violet?"'
- '"We''ll bring it to Violet," agreed Mr. Cordyce, resuming his shortcake.'
- After lunch he went to sleep in the easy-chair in the doctor's big office.
- That is, he threw his head back and shut his eyes, and breathed very heavily.
- Jess went through the room once with ice water, humming, for Violet was better.
- It was so gently done that even if he had been really asleep, he would never have
  wakened.
- '"No," he thought to himself, "if she really hated me, she would never have done
  that."'
- But the children were very far from hating him.
- They liked him immensely.
- '"I''d love to see him," said Violet earnestly.'
- '"How long you going to stay here?"'
- Benny piped up.
- '"As long as they''ll let me, my boy," answered the stranger quietly.'
- Then he left the sick room, for he knew he should not stay long.
- But something in the man's last sentence rang in Henry's ears.
- Often Henry thought he had caught hold of his truant memory.
- Then the man turned his head and he lost it again altogether.
- And he had said, "I like your spirit, my boy."
- That was it.
- Henry sat down out of sight and weeded geraniums for a few moments.
- It is a wonder he did not pull up geraniums instead of weeds, his mind was so far
  away.
- Then he was apparently thunderstruck afresh.
- He sat with his weeder on his knee and his mouth open.
- '"He''s the man who passed me the cup with the wings!"'
- He stole another look around the corner, and this satisfied him.
- '"Same man exactly," he said.'
- When he had finished the flower bed he thought he heard the young doctor moving
  in the office.
- He stuck his head in the open door.
- The doctor sat at his desk, taking notes from a book.
- '"Do you know who presented the prizes Field Day?"'
- '"Know what his name was?"'
- '"James Cordyce, of the Steel Mills," replied the doctor carelessly.'
- '"J. H. Cordyceover in Greenfield."'
- Dr. McAllister, to all appearances, returned to his notes.
- His eyes were lowered, at any rate.
- But for Henry the skies were reeling.
- He withdrew his head and sat still on the step.
- That delightful man his grandfather?
- It was impossible.
- He was too young, to begin with.
- Henry expected a white-haired gentleman with a cane and a terrible voice.
- But all the time, he knew in his soul that it was not only possible, but really
  true.
- Could it be that the man knew them without introducing himself?
- A perfect torrent of thoughts assailed Henry as he sat crouched on the office steps.
- It was clear to him now that Mrs. McAllister had failed to mention his name on purpose.
- It was a wonder Benny hadn't asked what it was, long before this.
- He noticed that the man was getting out of his chair under the trees.
- '"It''s now or never," thought Henry.'
- '"I''ve got to know!"'
- He walked eagerly after the man who was going toward the garden with his back turned.
- Henry easily caught up with him, breathing with difficulty.
- The man turned around.
- '"Are you James Henry Cordyce of Greenfield?"'
- '"I am, my boy," returned the man with a long look.'
- '"Does that question of yours mean that you know that I know that you are Henry
  James Cordyce?"'
- '"Yes," said Henry, simply.'
- A NEW GRANDFATHER In less than an hour the town was buzzing with the news.
- In fact the biggest part of the town knew it before the children themselves.
- Jess and Benny came across the lawn to select some white moonflowers for Violet's
  tray.
- They were just in time to hear Henry say, "But, Grandfather" "Grandfather!"
- '"Yes, Jess," said Henry eagerly.'
- '"He''s the man we''ve been running away from all this time."'
- '"I thought you was old," observed Benny.'
- '"And awf''ly cross.'
- Jess said so."
- '"I didn''t know, Benny," said Jess turning pink.'
- To think of running away from this kind friend!
- But her grandfather did not seem to mind.
- There was no stopping Benny.
- '"Where have you been living?"'
- The whole company looked at each other, even Dr. McAllister and his mother.
- Then they all laughed as if they never would stop.
- '"You just ought to see!"'
- '"You never saw it in the daytime!"'
- '"You don''t mean it!"'
- '"I have seen it quite a number of times in the daytime."'
- '"Seen what, in heaven''s name?"'
- '"That''s where Violet got her bronchitis," observed the doctor, "sitting by that
  pool.'
- She shouldn't have done it.
- I thought so from the first."
- '"You thought so?"'
- '"How did you know she sat by it?'
- I'm sure I didn't myself."
- '"I was your most frequent visitor," declared the doctor, enjoying himself hugely.'
- '"I hope you were our only one," said Jess with her mouth open.'
- '"Well, I think I was," said the doctor.'
- '"Why did you do that?"'
- '"I liked his looks," returned the doctor.'
- '"And I noticed that he didn''t tell much about himself, so I was curious."'
- '"But you surely didn''t see the freight car then," said Jess.'
- '"No, but I came back that night and hunted around," replied Dr. McAllister.'
- '"At about eleven o''clock!"'
- Henry cried.
- The doctor assented.
- '"Our rabbit!"'
- '"I made as little noise as possible when I saw the freight car.'
- Then I saw the door move, so I thought some one was inside.
- And when I heard the dog bark I was sure of it, and went home."
- '"But you came back?"'
- The doctor laughed.
- '"Didn''t you suspect they were my children?"'
- '"Didn''t you see my advertisement?'
- Why didn't you notify me at once?"
- '"They were having such a good time," confessed the doctor.'
- '"And I was, too.'
- I just wanted to see how long they could manage their own affairs.
- It was all tremendously interesting.
- Why, that boy and girl of yours are born business managers, Mr.
- Mr. Cordyce took note of this.
- '"But I don''t see, yet, how you knew Violet sat by the pool," said Jess curiously.'
- '"You couldn''t know that, of course," replied the doctor.'
- '"I went up twice when I knew Henry had taken the dog down to my barn to catch rats.'
- I hid behind the big white rock with the flat top."
- '"That''s Lookout Rock," explained Jess, "where we used to let Benny watch for Henry.'
- But we didn't hear you."
- '"No," said Dr. McAllister.'
- '"I didn''t even snap a twig those times.'
- But I had the very best time when I went with Mother."
- '"Have you seen it, too?"'
- '"I have, indeed!"'
- '"I have even had a drink from your well."'
- '"Every one has seen it but me," said Mr. Cordyce patiently.'
- '"We''ll show it to you!"'
- '"And I''ll show you my wheels made on a cart, and my bed out of hay, and my pink
  cup!"'
- '"Good for you, Benny," said Mr. Cordyce, pleased.'
- '"Have you got a house?"'
- You can live there with me, if you like it," replied Mr. Cordyce.
- '"I have been looking for you for nearly two months."'
- Under Mrs. McAllister's wonderful care, Violet soon became strong again.
- Many of them knew Henry as the boy who won the race, and were glad that he had found
  such a friend.
- But when the children reached their beloved home they were like wild things.
- '"See our ''building,''" shouted Benny, for that was what he always called the fireplace.'
- '"It burns really, too.'
- And this is the well, and this is the dishpan, and this is the 'frigerator'!"
- Each dish had a story of its own.
- '"That''s more than my dishes have," observed Mr. Cordyce.'
- Mrs. McAllister, who knew what his dishes were, was silent.
- '"Tomorrow," suggested Mr. Cordyce, as they drove home, "will you all come and see
  my house?"'
- A UNITED FAMILY Mr. Cordyce had been planning this day for more than a week.
- He had sent his most trusted foreman to his own beautiful home, to superintend matters
  there.
- On the very day that Mr. Cordyce received word that it was finished, he suggested
  the drive.
- '"Do you live all alone, Grandfather?"'
- '"All alone," answered Mr. Cordyce.'
- '"No company at all."'
- At first Benny did not consider this the exact truth.
- He considered a cook company, and also a butler, and a housekeeper.
- And when he saw the array of maids he kept perfectly quiet.
- The house was enormous, certainly.
- It was at least a quarter of a mile from its own front gateand everywhere were gardens.
- '"Do you live here?"'
- '"You do, too, if you like it," observed his grandfather, watching his face.'
- The inside of the house was more wonderful than even the older children had ever
  dreamed.
- The velvet rugs were so thick and soft that no footfall could be heard.
- Everywhere were flowers.
- The great stairway with steps of marble rose from the center of the big hallway.
- But it was upstairs that the children felt most at home.
- Here the rooms were not quite so large.
- They were sunny and homelike.
- '"This is Violet''s room!"'
- It was unmistakable.
- There were violets on the wallpaper.
- The bed was snow white with a thick quilt of violet silk.
- On the little table were English violets, pouring their fragrance into the room.
- '"What a beautiful room!"'
- But all the children shouted when they saw Benny's room.
- There was an electric train with cars nearly as large as the little boy himself.
- '"Can I run the cars all day?"'
- '"Oh, no," replied Henry quickly.'
- '"You''re going to school as soon as it begins."'
- '"The finest schools in the country," he said.'
- In Jess' room Benny discovered a bed for Watch.
- Watch got in at once, sniffed in every corner, turned around three times, and lay
  down.
- Just then a distant doorbell rang.
- The moment Jess heard that word "dog" she was frightened.
- '"They won''t take Watch away?"'
- '"Indeed they will not!"'
- '"We''ll never, never give him up."'
- However, Henry followed his grandfather and Jess with great anxiety.
- '"He''s a runaway, sir, from my kennels out in Townsend," the man explained to Mr.
  Cordyce.'
- '"I have two hundred Airedales out there, and this one was sold the day before he
  ran away.'
- So you see I have to turn him over to the lady I sold him to."
- '"Oh, no, you don''t," returned Mr. Cordyce quickly.'
- '"I will give you three times what the dog is worth."'
- The man glanced around uneasily.
- '"I couldn''t do that, sir," he explained.'
- '"You see, it isn''t a question of money; it''s a question of my promised word to
  the lady."'
- Mr. Cordyce failed to "see."
- '"She can find another dog, among two hundred Airedales, I guess," he returned.'
- '"And, besides, you don''t know positively that this is the right dog."'
- '"Excuse me," replied the man, very much embarrassed, "he''s the dog, all right.'
- He knows me, as you see.
- His name is Rough No.
- He has a black spot inside his ear."
- It was too true.
- Indeed, at the mere mention of his name the dog cocked an ear and wagged his tail.
- But he had seated himself as close to Jess as possible, and licked her hand when
  she patted him.
- But it appeared that Henry could understand the man's position even if Mr. Cordyce
  could not.
- He now put in a timid word of his own.
- '"If the lady would agree to let the dog go, would you be willing?"'
- '"Sure," said the man, shooting a glance at Henry.'
- '"I''m sure of it, my boy," returned Mr. Cordyce kindly.'
- The fact that Henry had been the first to make headway with the dog fancier, had
  not escaped him.
- The big car purred along from Greenfield to Townsend in no time.
- She was not terrible to look at.
- In fact she was quite young, quite lively, and very, very pretty.
- He could not wait for his grandfather to begin.
- By degrees the lady understood just what dog it was.
- Watch never leaves us even for a minute, ever since Jess took the briar out of his
  foot."
- '"So you are the children who lived in the freight car!"'
- '"I''ve heard all about that.'
- How did you like it?"
- '"All right," replied Henry, with an effort.'
- '"But we never could have done it without Watch.'
- He stayed and looked after the girls while I was away, and he just thinks everything
  of Jess."
- '"Well," said the young lady, laughing, "I can see you''re worrying terribly about
  that dog.'
- Now listen!
- I wouldn't take that dog away from you any more than I'd take Benny!
- In fact, not so much.
- I think maybe I'd like to keep Benny instead."
- Benny was apparently quite willing that she should.
- He climbed into her lap before any one could stop him, and gave her one of his best
  bear hugs.
- And from that moment they were firm friends.
- It made no difference to the children that Watch was a very valuable dog.
- It was a happy and reunited family which gathered around the Cordyce dining table
  that evening.
- Jess was the first one to long for the old freight car.
- '"O Grandfather," she said one morning, "I wish I could cook something once more
  in the old kettle."'
- '"Go out in the kitchen," said her grandfather, "and mess around all you like.'
- The maids will help you."
- And Benny was the last one to wish for his old home.
- '"Grandfather," he said one day, "I wish I could drink this milk out of my own pink
  cup!"'
- This set Mr. Cordyce to thinking.
- He had plenty of pink cups, it is true, but none of them were as dear to Benny as
  his own.
- '"I think I shall have to surprise you children," said Mr. Cordyce at last.'
- '"But before the surprise comes, perhaps you would like to see Benny''s pony."'
- Then he led the way to the stables.
- He owned several beautiful horses already, and nearly a dozen wonderful cars.
- But nothing was half so interesting as the pony.
- He was very small and very fat and black.
- His wavy tail was so long that it nearly touched the ground.
- Benny took a short ride around the stable, being "held on" by a groom.
- All the others sat down on the fragrant hay to watch him ride.
- '"What am I going to do when I grow up, Grandfather?"'
- '"You''re going to take my place, Henry, as president of the steel mills," replied
  Mr. Cordyce.'
- '"You will do it better than I ever have."'
- (And one day this came true, just as most of Mr. Cordyce's prophecies did.)
- '"And what am I going to do?"'
- '"All you children must go to school and then to college.'
- Then you may do whatever you choose for a living," replied Mr. Cordyce.
- (This also came true.)
- (This not only came true, but it is always and forever true, all over the world.)
- '"Am I going to college tomorrow?"'
- '"Not tomorrow, Benny," said his grandfather, laughing.'
- '"But I ''m glad you reminded me.'
- All you children must go over to Dr. McAllister's tomorrow, and stay while the surprise
  comes."
- '"Is the surprise very nice?"'
- '"No, not very," replied Mr. Cordyce with a twinkle.'
- '"Did it cost a great deal?"'
- '"It didn''t cost me anything," answered her grandfather.'
- '"The only thing I shall have to pay will be express."'
- (He didn't tell them that the express cost him several hundred dollars.)
- However, next day the children rode gladly over to see the kind doctor.
- They stayed until Mr. Cordyce telephoned to them that the surprise was ready.
- And then Mrs. McAllister and her son rode back with them in the big car.
- Mr. Cordyce was as happy as a boy.
- Among the trees was the surprise.
- It was the old freight car!
- Everything was in place.
- Here was Benny's pink cup, and here was his bed.
- Here was the big kettle and the tablecloth.
- And hanging on a near-by tree was the old dinner bell.
- Benny rang the bell over and over again, and Watch rolled on the floor and barked
  himself hoarse.
- The children were never homesick after that.
- To be sure, a dull and ugly freight car looked a little strange in a beautiful Italian
  garden.
- But it was never dull or ugly to the Cordyce children or their dog.
- They never were so happy as when showing visitors each beauty of their beloved old
  home.
- And there were many visitors.
- Some of them were fascinated by the stories of the wonderful dishes and the shelf.
- And the children never grew tired of telling them over and over again.
- '"He likes the old home best," said Jess Cordyce, smiling at him and patting his
  rough back.'
- And as Benny would say, if he hadn't grown up, "That's true, I shouldn't wonder."
