A simple app to help kids with sight words. It tracks the progress of

choose good practice/test words.

Using pip, run `pip install .` from the root folder.

## Usage:

### Setup:
Create a new datafile to track results by calling:

```sight_words new_data_file <student_name>.yml <grade>```

```sight_words test <student_name>.yml```
